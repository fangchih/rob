<p>Congrats on your promotion! Nice work with the skill percentage.  I wouldn't have been able to figure it out myself.  BTW, on the cardlist page, it's showing double.  I would try to fix it, but I have no clue what is causing it.  Thanks for you contributions!

<p>Great work on the skill effect.
</p><p>It seems you've fixed the JPN card as well, which, I think, might be a waste of time. Because eventually, their effect and skill name will be changed during westernization, which is why I didn't fix most of them, and leave it there waiting for it to be released in US version for the final fix. That would save us a lot of work. Of course I also tried to add card that will most likely keep its name.
</p><p>If there was one thing our visitor should know about the unreleased card, I think it should be what its skill was and how it looked like, not how much percentage it would increase.
</p><p>But anw good job. And the recent page now look like someone created a big mess with you being the cleaner lol.

<p>I have a question with some of the changes to the template.  First, are all max stats normally 2.5 times atk1/def1?  I think for the most part, there is a slight variation on this stat.  Take for instance <a href="Ancient_Elf.html" title="Ancient Elf">Ancient Elf</a>.  At 2.5 it would be 7875 with the auto-calc template which would throw off the evo table.  Actual max stat is 7980.  That's a significant difference.  Actual percentage increase is 153.33% or 1.5333 (needing to round up after calculation).  Second (well not a question but a statement), the reason I left off event skills in #vardefine is because Cygames had been changing the names (for most of them) with each evolution.  See <a href="Geri_and_Freki.html" title="Geri and Freki">Geri and Freki</a> as an example.  Other than those, I like the #switch: function, although, I wouldn't know how to use it.  8^)

<dl><dd> Yes and that is why it is only a template, there are so many cases where the template would fail; for example 2 max evo cards, different max atk/def stats, different skills per evo, etc. Those will need to be handled on a case-by-case basis. It is just majority of the cards this template works fine and makes creating new cards a tad bit easier. And it is not so much auto-calculating (except for the part of atk2/3/4 stats), the rest is just defined at the top and then filled in for you later.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd> And is that "I would know how to use it" or "wouldn't". If the latter, it is quite easy if you need a explanation of how to use I would be happy to do so, but maybe on something more of an IM system, as explaining 1 post at a time could take sometime.</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd> Ok. Yeah, I wouldn't know how to use it and IM would definitely be better in that instance.  As far as max stats, I just think that entering the data when someone has the actual max stats would be less work rather than going back in and having to change it every time.  I've calculated the max stats using your formula, and none would work.  The percentage increase from base to max on form one is too varied (1.06% to 1.742% - from what I've calculated from a few known cards).  I would tend to think that leaving max_atk and max_def in its previous version would be more appropriate.  It would prevent the need to go back in and change it constantly.  Probably also the same with the event skill.  But looks like Cygames has eased on the changing of event skill names in the latter cards (minus the 4th form) for the most part.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>First, I just wanted to say that you and others are doing a great job keeping the content of site neat, organized, and as accurate as possible, so much thanks for that.
Second, I was wondering if you guys can just add the default evolution table for now for the cards that don't have one (e.g. Lord Arthur, Lucifer, Zeus, Legendary Muse, etc.) instead of having nothing.  Some inaccurate information is better than no information. Most people just need to compare stats and make an educated guess as to what cards to get in comparison to others.  If we know for a fact that the evolution table is incorrect, we can leave a note on the individual pages like we do now so that people are aware.  This is better than having no stats at all in all the other pages.

</p><p>This was totally an educated guess on my part about how the multiplier page worked. Of course, you see the standard (STD) set of numbers, which applies for both ATK and DEF for a standard card.  When I was looking into it, I was looking at how Beowulf/Dark Angel Olivia/Diana evo tables were being calculated, there were 4 sets of numbers ATK1/ATK2 and DEF1/DEF2 (which I cleaned up and renamed as the HERO set).  The first set of numbers for ATK/DEF come from the multipliers of each base unenhanced in every evo that you find in the archives (e.g. evo1atk/evo1atk, evo2atk/evo1atk, evo3atk/evo1atk, evo4atk/evo1atk, etc.). Initially, I thought only 1 set of numbers was enough to get the correct evolution numbers in the table, so I got rid of the second set of ATK2/DEF2 numbers.  Doing that ended up messing up the numbers by a much larger percentage than they were before.  So I realized that the 2nd set of numbers are used to average the numbers out to their actual values in the game.  I still don't fully understand how this is all calculated, but I didn't bother trying to after I figured this out.  The one thing you do need to know is the actual values of a 4-7, 6-11, or 8-15 evolution of these cards in the game so that you can make the adjustments accordingly.
</p><p>Making ATK1 set of numbers equal to the ATK2 set of numbers is the same as having one set of ATK numbers in the calculator. If the evolution table is off my a lot (e.g. anything greater than 1 point is considered off), then you need to modify the 2nd set of numbers to either be higher or lower to match the actual numbers of the cards you know of (e.g. the numbers of the 4-7, 6-11, or 8-15 that you know are correct in the game).  These adjustments are usually off by less than 1%, so you just play around with the numbers until you get close enough.
</p><p>I was able to make the numbers perfect for the Titans, but not the Brutes, because I don't know the actually numbers for a 8-15.  I hope you're able to figure it out, because other than this, I have no idea how it's all calculated.
