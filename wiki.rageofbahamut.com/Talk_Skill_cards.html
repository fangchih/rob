<p>[2012/11/08]
</p><p>I tested out other ++ versions and the formula returns perfect every time. I'm not seeing the results you are talking about. I'd check your data.

</p><p>[2012/11/08]
</p><p>Added values to table and page for Hermes...
Ecksofa/Pylgrim... I have used that formula extesively and have created an excel doc that utilizes it to calculate everything quick and easy. I get 36494 as well... Thoughts on variations dealt because of ++ vs. ff.  I have only tested the formula in my spreadsheet with FF cards and it is very accurate with my deck and the three people I have sent to test it.
-jclovs
</p><p>[2012/11/02]
</p><p>Yeah, I tested it with your data and I get the 60 points difference as well. 36494 instead of 36432. I dont know the reason, but maybe I play around with my cards, when I find the time for it. -Ecksofa
</p><p>[2012/09/09]
</p><p>I tried the below formula and I found that it applies correctly for a single proc, ecksofa. However, with 2 or more procs it starts throwing bigger numbers than expected. See for example my case for [07/11] (which I still insist has the correct formula): If you use your formula for the first card, Valkyrie (13982 + 5% + (5%+15%+10%)) you get basically the same result I got, allowing for round-ups. However, if you use the same formula to calculate the second card's damage, you'll get a bigger amount than actually dealt (by about 60.)

</p><p>[2012/09/09]
</p><p>The correct skill boost formula is
</p>
<pre>base_atk * (100% + order) * (100% + leader) * (100% + skills + morale + realm)
Round up before each multiplication

I tested it myself with different skill cards, with and without realm bonus but order bonus and it works perfectly.
</p><p>small hit atk (all) is 2%:
Ares vs dancer. dancer slvl1, ares(max) gets order- and realmboost. 7150 atk base and after realm/order-bonus and hit by dancer: 7734
7150*1,05*(1,05+0,02)=7734

</p><p><br />
[2012/08/23] Yeah, I saw it at 10%, but then recently someone changed it back to 5%. So I decided to do a test for myself, glad it confirms with your test. I agree that it doing a more clean test if safer and I'll probably do it next time, its just I was borrowing a friend's Luci so I wanted to do it quickly. Also just did some clean tests with Prisoner Luci and Fallen Luci so we can fill in some of the other numbers. Here are my results:
</p>
<pre>No realm, Order building, or ATK leader bonuses.
Prisoner Luci: Thunderbird++ from 5784 atk to 5495 atk. 5784*0.95=5494.8 (rounds up to 5495), 
  Therefore "Medium hit to foe's ATK/DEF (all)" is 5%
Fallen Luci: Thunderbird++ from 5784 atk to 5322 atk. 5784*0.92=5321.28 (rounds up to 5322),
  Therefore "Big hit to foe's ATK/DEF (all)" is 8%

</p><p>[2012/08/23] I thought the dark knight had already proven and it was set at 10%? I made my own personal record of what I've tested and what was proven here and it was already at that. True with the way the other numbers look on previous sets it should be different and probably is and once someone obtains the cards for a clean test we'll post the results and change it. I want to say again though that for the record that the best way to test is without any bonuses at all including realm bonus. Thanks for the info though.

</p><p>[2012/08/23] I did a simple to for "Great hit to foe's ATK/DEF (all)". The ATK deck consisted of Pricipality base MAX (8000 atk) with ATK leader boost, while the DEF deck consisted of FF DK Luciella lvl 1 skill. As I posted in the Test Data table, my final atk value went from 8000 to 7560 which is exactly 8000*1.05*0.9=7560. Therefore the "Great hit to foe's ATK/DEF (all)" effect is 10%, unless hit to foe's ATK and DEF percentage is different I think it is conclusive evidence that it is 10%. Which seems strange to me because "Great hit to foe's ATK (all)" is also 10%, since ATK/DEF is more general so it should be less. I am changing the value on the page to reflect this test. 
</p>
<ul><li>edit: Note there was no Order building bonus for ATK deck --<a href="User_KuroSetsuna29.html" title="User:KuroSetsuna29">KuroSetsuna29</a></li></ul>
<p>[2012/08/10] I've pretty much confirmed my theory on the application of bonuses (as seen below.) This time, I attacked with 3 Valkyries (one with skill lvl 3, another 2 and the third, 1) which all procced and got no hits from the opponent cards. By using the method below (i.e. going card by card but only stacking each card's own ability on top of the Realm+Order bonuses while each other cards' abilities apply to its base) I obtained exactly the damage dealt with a negligible margin of error (just 5! as in the number five, not a percentage) which must come from rounding up decimals at more steps than I did. Personally, I consider the matter settled and invite everyone to do their own tests to be convinced themselves. --<a href="index7d07.html?title=User:Pylgrim&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Pylgrim (page does not exist)">Pylgrim</a>
</p><p>[2012/08/08] It would be better if you posted before changing any of the numbers entirely. It was stated below that the skills are processed by each card individually then added together as a total after that. Also all I see is your total attack of the numbers and not even a sig to identify you by. Post each of your cards attacks so that we can do the calculations ourselves and figure it out. One test is not definitive result and without sufficient data it's hard to prove. Plus the fact the game itself declares it as a 5% increase. Also as stated before if you want a clean look you need to do a single card, no other bonuses or hits calculated in. Then take the base attack by what it was increased by. We've not figured out exactly how all the other bonuses add into it and affect each other. I'll do a clean test in a min and post my results. If they match I'll leave it but if not I'll change it back.
</p>
<ul><li>Edit*</li></ul>
<p>As well I just noticed you didn't include if you get a realm and/or order bonus as well. Here are my results:
</p><p>Base Naga: Before 1160 att, After 1218, = .05 = 5% increase as stated. 
</p><p>No hits to my attack, no other bonuses including realm or order bonuses calculated. So I'm going to change it back. Please for future reference if you want to change anything here please show complete data so others can calculate your findings and also run tests of their own. Also include a sig or at least an IGN so as to be recognized by. Thank you.

</p><p>[2012/08/08] I edited the attack leader bonus to 4% because that was what I was getting when I attack. Using 3 NMs and 2 trows, all 4-6, all NMs skill 10, 2 procced, no enemy hits to my attack, and with order and realm bonus, I get 138723 which is exactly 83347*1.14*1.46. I dont know about defense leaders.
</p><p>[2012/08/07] Aidrys: Perhaps there's simply a misuse of the term "stack" in your latest post, but just to make sure: As far as I can tell from  my own tests, bonuses other than those of the cards themselves (realm, bonus, morale, leader) do not 'stack', i.e. they are not applied in a consecutive order, each of them using the result of the latest as a base value. Rather they are all summed together and that value is applied to the base value. The result will be the new base value onto which each card will apply its own bonus (if it procs); that's the only case of "stacking" as fare as I'm aware.
</p><p>Valordux: Of course I don't believe the 0.25% that seems to randomly appear in single-proc cases is actually random; it must come from an actual interaction of the values involved. I called it that because I have no other way to explain it at the moment. As I said before, I also once believed that it was a result of realm and order bonuses stacking. However, the fact that the other additional bonuses don't seem to stack and that that 0.25% increase doesn't appear in cases with 2 or more procs suggests that the theory is flawed. --<a href="index7d07.html?title=User:Pylgrim&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Pylgrim (page does not exist)">Pylgrim</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/28] They are and it's been verified before. The leader bonuses stack with the realm and order bonus because each of those bonuses hit both decks at the same time. The card bonuses each stack before they move onto the other ones deck.

</p><p><br />
[2012/07/28] That's actually what I meant.  I've modified the formula to fix that up.  I'm unsure as to how the leader bonuses work though, so I'll leave that out for now.  I would assume they're calculated with the realm/order part though. --<a href="index327b.html?title=User:Valordux&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Valordux (page does not exist)">Valordux</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/28] It's how ever you wanna do it to be honest. One thing is you forgot to include the Attack or Defense Leader bonus. The rest looks ok but from other statistics shown it needs to be done on a per card bases then added together after each calculation.

</p><p>[2012/07/27] I've actually tried calculating my damage with my full attack set before (only 65k, but it's more than the tests here), and they seem to be consistently:
</p>
<pre>i = card number
r = 1 if realm bonus exists, 0 otherwise
o = 1 if order bonus exists, 0 otherwise
ba = base attack
b1 =&#160;% of boost
b2 =&#160;% of boost
b3 =&#160;% of boost
attack(i) = ba * [1+(.05*r)+(.05*o)]+[(b1*a)+(b2*a)+(b3*a)]
Total Attack = Sum of the attack(i) for all cards in attack deck
</pre>
<p>I'll post actual numbers on my full ATK deck when I attack someone without a hit activating.  The thing is that I can not get the hit damage to work.  I have a deck of 5 Agnis that I will be posting shortly here.  Side question: should we start using the discussion tags?  It'll make things easier to read.  Example is down on the very bottom of the page.  --<a href="index327b.html?title=User:Valordux&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Valordux (page does not exist)">Valordux</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/23] I believe part of the inconsistencies is the fact we've been doing controlled outcomes with relatively low overall attack and def bases. I believe if we used higher combined attacks and def we'll see a slightly different outcome that would explain why at lower levels that no matter which way you do the calculations it comes out to be very close in proximity. When I have more time after this event I'll mess around a bit more.

</p><p>[2012/07/22] In trying to figure some of this out myself earlier yesterday, I happened to see this discussion here.  Pylgrim, I don't believe that +0.25% is a random bonus.  I think what's happening is that the order bonuses and realm bonuses are actually multiplied together (rather than added).  Note that the difference between 5%+5% and 105%*105% is 0.25%.  Take a simple base damage of 100 for example.  If I do 5%+5%, I get 110, correct?  Now do 100*1.05*1.05.  That equals 110.25, which rounds up to 111.  Let me know if you think there's a flaw/inconsistency in my explanation though.
--<a href="index327b.html?title=User:Valordux&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Valordux (page does not exist)">Valordux</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/14] Yeah, sorry, I didn't think of writing down the actual numbers. When I saw the discrepancy, the first thing I thought was what you said: The "morale" bonus being stacked on top of the "new base value" rather than added to the bonuses. However, that gives a full additional 1% (the 10% of 10%) which blows over the the actual damage I dealt. Adding that 10% to the other bonuses and then applying the random +0.25% bonus got me my expected result, though.--<a href="index7d07.html?title=User:Pylgrim&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Pylgrim (page does not exist)">Pylgrim</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/13] Not seeing any numbers you had included with the morale bonus did you try calculating the morale bonus outside of the realm and order bonuses? If you do the morale bonus after with your included formula it comes out to 40926 but calculating it all together comes out with 40586 so a bit of a difference which might be why the mystery bonus seems to come into play. I think all our assumptions have been they added each card together then took the bonuses from that. Instead it looks like they take each card as an individual and calculates each bonus per card then combines them for a total which would explain the mystery bonus we never could explain before. Appreciate the input and it all makes a bit more sense now&#160;:) I'll experiment with it more when I have time after the weekend or late evenings.
</p><p>--<a href="indexa3f7.html?title=User:Aidrys&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Aidrys (page does not exist)">Aidrys</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/11] Ah, of course I don't mind. I also tried putting Brun first, Valk second and still got the same damage, which is not surprise, but good to know for sure that there are no unknown variables. 
</p><p>Speaking of variables, I just got a "morale bonus" (10%) and battled right after with the same deck. Only Valkyrie procced so in theory the formula should be: BASE + 20% (all the external bonuses added together) + 15% (Valk's skill). The result, however, falls slightly shorter than the actual damage dealt. Guess what? it's the return of our friend, the mystery bonus. Adding + 0.25% to the external bonuses results in exactly the amount of damage dealt.
</p><p>For all it seems, the game assigns a 0.25% to the new base value for all cases in which only one card procs. Super random, I know, but that's how the numbers look. --<a href="index7d07.html?title=User:Pylgrim&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Pylgrim (page does not exist)">Pylgrim</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/11] Pylgrim, some of the numbers in your second box had typos. I hope you don't mind that I fixed them. The calculations look good though.
</p><p>So was Valkyrie Hild in slot one and Brunhilde in slot two of your deck? It's interesting that the effects are applied in the manner that you described. --<a href="indexdd9e.html?title=User:Wlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wlin (page does not exist)">Wlin</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/11] Ah yeah, I was being led astray by my own assumption that skill bonuses stack, thanks for confirming that they don't. That made all the pieces fall into place. Funnily enough, the animation is actually a faithful indication of how things stack. For illustration, I'll present the case I've been studying all this time:
</p>
<pre>Valkyrie Hild ATK = 13982 Great Boost to Gods ATK (15%)
Brunilde++ ATK = 12752 Big Boost to All ATK lvl3 (10%)
Total ATK = 26734
Actual damage dealt after both procs = 36432
</pre>
<p>So the sequence goes like this: 
</p>
<pre>Valk's "turn": 
She gets +5% ATK from order bonus and +5% from realm bonus = 13982 + 10% = 13982 + 1398.2 = 15380.2. Round up to 15381 (new "base value")
Her ability procs = 15381 + 15% = 15381 + 2307.15 = 17688.15. Round up to 17689.
</pre>
<pre>Brun's "turn":
She gets +5% ATK from order bonus and +5% from realm bonus = 12752 + 10% = 12752 + 1275.2 = 14027.2. Round up to 14028 (new "base value")
Her ability procs = 14028 + 10% = 14028 + 1402.8 = 15430.8. Round up to 15431.
</pre>
<p>Here's where the animation hinted me what was going on behind curtains: Valk's proc triggers <i>before</i> Brun's numbers are calculated and Brun's proc triggers <i>after</i> Valk's numbers have been calculated. How does the computer apply their bonuses to each other, then? Here's the twist: it applies them to their corresponding "real" base values, not the ones including order and realm bonuses. So:
</p>
<pre>Valk's ATK becomes 17689 + (13982 x 0.10) = 17689 + 1398.2 = 19087.2. Round up again to 19088.
Brun's ATK becomes 15431 + (12752 x 0.15) = 15431 + 1912.8 = 17343.8. Round up again to 17344.
</pre>
<pre>Total ATK = 19088 + 17344 = 36432. Success!!
</pre>
<p>Interestingly, the "mystery bonus" doesn't appear anywhere in this formula. --<a href="index7d07.html?title=User:Pylgrim&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Pylgrim (page does not exist)">Pylgrim</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/11] No matter how you calculate it, it always seems to come up just the 1 short or completely off. My only educated guess is there's some unforeseen percentages or decimals we're not taking into account. Something similar to the enhancing of cards and improving the attack and defense. Nothing is absolute as we think it is. It's possible too that some cards don't have a specific attack or defense and has a hidden decimal once we start to evolve or enhance. *shrugs* something to think about I guess lol.

</p><p>[2012/07/10] Hope you guys like puzzles. I did a test with Mime (2270 ATK) and Holy Hild (6730 ATK). Combined, they have 9000 ATK. Both card skills proc'd and the result was 10469 ATK.
</p>
<pre>Base                    9000
Mime 2270 x 0.25         567.5 (Mime's big boost to self ATK/DEF)
Mime 2270 x 0.10         227   (Holy Hild's medium boost to gods ATK)
Holy Hild 6730 x 0.10    673   (Holy Hild's medium boost to gods ATK)
------------------------------
Expected ATK           10467.5
Actual ATK             10469
</pre>
<p>Since both cards' ATK were evenly divisible by ten, there would have been no carry-over from Holy Hild's 10% boost. This leaves only the Mime's 25% self-boost to account for any discrepancies from rounding. --<a href="indexdd9e.html?title=User:Wlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wlin (page does not exist)">Wlin</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/10] Good point about the order of effects being applied. I had assumed that they were in the order presented, but it's possible that's not the case. Here are the results of some testing with Hild. No boosts other than from the attacking cards and the opponent had no debuffs.<br />
</p>
<pre>Hild (Small boost to gods ATK):                 3750 -&gt;  3938 (5%)
Holy Hild (Medium boost to gods ATK):           6730 -&gt;  7404 (10%)
St. Hild (Big boost to gods ATK):               8435 -&gt;  9532 (13%)
St. Hild + Holy Hild (only Big boost):         15165 -&gt; 17137 (13%)
St. Hild + Holy Hild (both Big and Med boost): 15165 -&gt; 18654 (23%)
</pre>
<p>It looks like boosts from cards are summed up before being affected by other boosts. --<a href="indexdd9e.html?title=User:Wlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wlin (page does not exist)">Wlin</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/10] I'm doing a few myself too before bed. I did test my agni with the 15% boost after each of the 5% bonuses and came up with a higher number. As if the effectiveness is lowered by around 0.7% of the final percent but even that's not exact. I'm going to test a couple other cards and see if I can't find something they all have in common if I test it with enough cards. I'll also test it with only a variable amount of the beginning bonuses along with the final card bonus and see if that makes a difference. So it would seem as well the only real way to figure out the exact card bonuses seems to be without any other applying bonuses before them. I'll look into it and post my notes. 
</p><p>Also it might be a good idea to note that just because something has a specific order in the battle animation doesn't mean it necessarily happens that way in the calculations. It seems before the animation starts all the data calculating has already been done. Hence why you can skip them all together and still obtain the same rewards without viewing it.

</p><p>[2012/07/10] Actually, I did the Hild test a few days ago to post to the Wiki, but when I noticed that the final ATK was different from what I expected, I decided to wait until I had time to review. Aidrys, I'll check as well to see if the rounding is done per effect or done at the very end.--<a href="indexdd9e.html?title=User:Wlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wlin (page does not exist)">Wlin</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/10]Ok if the mystery effect is there then it takes place after the realm bonus. I just tested it against the 3 beginning bonuses leading up to realm and the attack is just as expected. My findings will be below. I had to wait till my clan leader changed my status to attack leader to test hence why it wasn't done before.
</p><p>On a 4-1 Atlas my begining attack is 7425. Ending attack was 8597.<br />
7425*.05=371.25<br />
371.25+7425=7796.25<br />
7796.25*.05=389.8125<br />
389.8125+7796.25=8186.0625<br />
8186.0625*.05=409.303125<br />
409.303125+8186.0625=8595.365625<br />
</p><p>I know this is 1 point off but if you take and remove the decimals and round up before you calculate the next 5% the ending number instead becomes 8596.35 which once again rounded up becomes the total attack.
</p><p>I will test more in a few moments once I do a couple more things that include the realm and etc bonuses stacked against an individual card bonus. I notice there's not been any data above as well as to the exact percentage of the hild small boost to a single realm attack. Could that be part of the issue too when it comes to the hild? Not saying anyones wrong but just an observation&#160;:) --<a href="indexa3f7.html?title=User:Aidrys&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Aidrys (page does not exist)">Aidrys</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/10] Yeah, I'm pretty sure that that mystery bonus is either of the Realm/Order bonus affecting the other. Hopefully you can figure out why when you add a second booster one of the bonuses seem to be halved. To clarify, I've tried this with two card; one proccing and the other one not. In that case, the formula works perfectly. The problem starts when there's a second proc and you get definitely less than the formula would make you believe. --<a href="index7d07.html?title=User:Pylgrim&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Pylgrim (page does not exist)">Pylgrim</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/10] Looks like <b>101.115.145.242</b> may be correct in that the Order Join bonus (or not) is applied a bit differently from the other boosts.
</p><p>3750 * 0.05 = 187.5 Order Join boost<br />
3750 * 0.05 = 187.5 Realm Match boost<br />
(3750 + 187.5) * 0.05 = 196.875 Small boost to gods ATK stacked with Realm Match<br />
187.5 * 0.05 = 9.375 <b>Mystery boost</b> applied to Order Join boost<br />
3750 + 187.5 + 196.875 + 196.875 = 4331.25 rounded up to <b>4332</b>.
</p><p>It's not possible with the data I have to say for sure that's how the game arrived at that result, so I'll gather more data with additional cards, perhaps add in a second card to the attack that doesn't receive the Realm Match boost, etc. --<a href="indexdd9e.html?title=User:Wlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wlin (page does not exist)">Wlin</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/10] Confirmed the example I gave below with Hild at <b>3750</b> ATK plus Order Join, Realm Match and Small boost to gods ATK resulted in <b>4332</b> ATK. My opponent was Man realm and used Hobbit to defend, so it shouldn't have affected my ATK. --<a href="indexdd9e.html?title=User:Wlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wlin (page does not exist)">Wlin</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/10] I'll chime in here and mention that one of my tests resulted in an ATK that was different from what I expected and it seems plausible that it's caused by one or more boosts not stacking as <b>101.115.145.242</b> says (feel free to leave a sig, any sig, just so we don't have to refer to you by IP address).
</p><p>In my case, I had a Hild with 3750 ATK with the following boosts:<br />
Order Join (5%)<br />
Realm Match (5%)<br />
Small boost to gods ATK (5%)<br />
</p><p>If you take 3750 and apply the 1.05 multiplier three times, you actually get 4341.09375 which rounds up to <b>4342</b>. However, the actual ATK value after battle was <b>4332</b>. If I use the method described by <b>101.115.145.242</b>, I get 4321.875, which doesn't match the game's result either. I'll collect more data later today with and without the Order Join and Realm Match bonuses. Or, someone can point out if I made a mistake. I'll also re-o the battle that game these results in the first place. --<a href="indexdd9e.html?title=User:Wlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wlin (page does not exist)">Wlin</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/10] *sighs* not what I meant. here's an example formula based on no attack boosts or hits to attack except the order bonus and realm bonus. The 3 bonuses go in this order by the way. Starts with Order, Att/Def Leader, lastly realm bonus.
</p><p>On a 4-1 Atlas my begining attack is 7425. Ending attack was 8187.<br />
7425*.05=371.25<br />
371.25+7425=7796.25<br />
7796.25*.05=389.8125<br />
389.8125+7796.25=8186.0625<br />
</p><p>The only way that it factors out completely is you assume they always take the decimal point and round to the next number. They never round dat case it does come out to 8187. My point is that each increase is added to the total before the next one takes effect. Yes they do stack in that manor. No they do not take the total percentages then add it to the base and that in turn determines your ending stats. It's basic math really and each of the 3 beginning bonuses does add a 5% bonus. That's the only point I was trying to get across. I hope that sorta clarifies what I was trying to say before. --<a href="indexa3f7.html?title=User:Aidrys&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Aidrys (page does not exist)">Aidrys</a>
</p><p><br />
[2012/07/10] I assure you that not everything stacks and that was one of my biggest "discoveries". Either the order bonus or the realm bonus doesn't stack with anything but it's simply added to total; logic suggests that the one that doesn't stack is the order bonus -which is not an aspect intrinsically tied to the card- but I'll eventually test using cards that get one or the other but not both to make sure of it. Either way, the one that doesn't stack is affected by the one that stacks, getting an additional 5% which comes to be a 0.25% of the base value. As I said, that formula should work with any one given card with boost proc and both realm and order bonus and I've successfully used it to predict final damage dealt.
</p><p>On the matter of 2 procs, the only advancement I've made is to realize that I'll obtain the actual damage dealt if I replace 5% with 2.5% in the corresponding part of the formula for only one of the cards. I cannot figure why yet, but the numbers are precise enough to disregard it as a coincidence. Nevertheless, I believe the heart of the matter is in the stacking order and that not much importance should be given to decimals. As Wlin points below, the computer simply rounds up to the nearest integer after calculating each card in the deck. That means that you shouldn't expect a deviance any higher than mere 5 from your maths to the actual result. 
</p><p>[2012/07/10] The closest I've come to figuring things out is each boost increases by the total amount of the previous boost + whatever the values were before hand. So instead of say a realm bonus + order bonus + attack or def leader bonus doesn't equal a 15% boost of the base combined attack. It's realm bonus + base value = new value. New value + order bonus = 2nd new value and so forth. Which makes it very hard to accurately calculate the exact bonuses each card gives you when you have the possibility of 3 bonuses stacking before that. I think they don't quite add up because each stack includes the decimals in the attack and/or def then rounds the total number and gives you what you see. That or keeps them hidden and in the off chance of a tie between numbers the winner would be decided by the decimal points you don't see. None of it's been really tested though. For the most part the purpose of this section to eliminate the variables and do our best to figure out each cards boost by factors that are easily measured.
</p><p>A cards skill level is easy to measure because doesn't stack. It just adds a clean 1% rounded to original boost. When you attack while in an order and with 1 or more boosts it becomes hard to measure. Again I think the main objective is to just figure out the base boosts and then we can go figuring out more from there. I've also systematically found a way to test hits to an opponents def and boosts to a given opponents def without seeing the actual numbers. I'll post those results in a day or 2 once I find time to post the full findings and how I went about it.--<a href="indexa3f7.html?title=User:Aidrys&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Aidrys (page does not exist)">Aidrys</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/10] I've been experimenting a lot to figure how the different bonuses (order, realm and "boost to" skills) stack and now I have a definite formula that works for every single case... in which only 1 card procs. it goes like this: The order bonus affect both the base value and the realm bonus. In other words: Order Bonus = [Base Value +5%]+[Realm Bonus (which is 5%)+5%] = [100% + 5%] + 5.25%. Why [100% + 5%] and not 105%? Because the order bonus is not stacked on nor stacks on anything; it will always be a 5% of the base value. The stack starts with the realm bonus and then you add that 5% order bonus. To Illustrate, here's how the formula works with Valkyrie Hild skill lv1 (+15% to Gods ATK): 5% + [(100% + 5.25%) + 15%] = 126%. You can test it yourself: any battle  with Valkyrie (with any ATK value) in which you have an order and realm bonus and her skill (and only hers) procs, the net result will be a 126% boost. I used the formula to predict that replacing Valk with my Brunhilde skill lv3 (+10%) would give me a net increase of 120.775% (5% + [105.25% + 10%]) over the base value and I got exactly that.
</p><p>The only problem is, as I've hinted before, the formula stops working when two or more boosting cards proc. As far as I can tell, skills do stack on the previous boosted value (calculating the percentages over the base value for each skill always results in a much smaller value than the obtained.) However when applying the above formula, the result overshoots the actual outcome by around 1% and I've cracked my head over this and can't understand why. Any ideas?
</p><p>Anyway, I've bolded the values for "Great Increase to 1 type's ATK" and "Big Increase to All's ATK" and took the liberty to fix some values (though not bold them) to make sense with the values we have bolded.
</p><p>[2012/07/07]I know I'm not breaking new ground by adding what I have since it all confirms what is already there but I figure the more evidence supporting it the better ground it will hold. I'm not sure how to add in levels, but since a couple of my cards are increased skill levels but show variances between 2 of the same card with different skill levels I'll just add it to the end of the card name. If I'm setting any of it up wrong let me know. My first time adding to anything Wiki related. Also I have things set up and within the next week or 2 I plan on a reliable way to verify defense percentages and hits again respective attack and defense of opponents as well.
FYI: All my attacks were against a friends deck which only boosted only it's own defense and did no hits to my own card. --<a href="indexa3f7.html?title=User:Aidrys&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Aidrys (page does not exist)">Aidrys</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/05] Good to know the 1% skill boost is also accurate. Thanks for clarifying that the rounding is always rounded up, and they only used round boost percentages so far. I'll try to gather some test data as well, with an order-realm-match. --<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> 04:07, 5 July 2012 (CDT) 
</p><p>[2012/07/04] Vayu and Vampire Lord used to confirm "big hit to realm ATK" is 13%. Vayu reduced ATK by 16%, but its skill level was 4, so it had an extra 3% effect.
</p><p>[2012/07/04] If someone would be so kind as to fix the effect query in the table above for Dark Knight Luciella, I'd greatly appreciate it. --<a href="indexdd9e.html?title=User:Wlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wlin (page does not exist)">Wlin</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/04] I wanted to note that while 4796 represents a decrease of 5.25% from the starting value of 5048 for the High Dancer test data, it still reflects a 5% decrease based on the way CyGames' rounding is applied elsewhere. If you take 5% of 5048 (252.4), and subtract that from 5048, you get 4795.6 which is rounded up to the nearest integer, resulting in 4796. This is the same as multiplying 5048 by 0.95 and rounding up, which is likely how the game calculates the effect. Either way, it's consistent with the rounding used when calculating carry-over in card evolutions. --<a href="indexdd9e.html?title=User:Wlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wlin (page does not exist)">Wlin</a>
</p><p>[2012/07/04] Glad to be of help. I'll add as much test data as I can with the cards that I have. --wlin
</p><p>[2012/07/04] Regarding the first list of percentages above the table, this was 2 months old, based on very little test data. Removed now one the table beneath is much more accurate. I should have put up a warning tag once i gave up on finding the source. Done so now, and asked for other's their input. Thanks for your critical input, and some test data. --<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> 03:34, 4 July 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[2012/07/04] Based on tests done in Training mode, some of the numbers on this page appear to be incorrect. For example, the page states that a small boost is 2.5%, but when the Hellhound's skill procs, its ATK goes up from 1120 to 1143, a 2% improvement. Also, a medium boost to demons ATK is listed at 8% (1 type, ATK increase, medium), but when the Succubus' skill procs, its ATK goes up from 2240 to 2464, a 10% improvement. I would strongly recommend that all the numbers in the table be verified with observed results instead of copied from elsewhere and assumed correct. Perhaps also remove the first section; it doesn't take into account effect targets. --wlin *edited* Removed again my incorrect comment regarding multiplicative effects.

<p>Nice job Biuken, it looks great. There are only some concerns that I may point out. One is that I see you only listed the base cards, and some special cards like DK Luci improves her skill after each evolution (I can only think of luci at the moment). Also, I was curious as to the values of each skills, is it dynamically grabbed from the wiki page for example or is it hard-coded constant you put in? And if you don't mind me adding a suggestion, this would be great for sharing your deck if you could allow it to create a hashcode so that you may share it to other people and it would load in their deck. But in any case, it looks great, I like how you show where the numbers are coming from.

<p>Hi,
Thank you.
Cards list is hard coded, since every ability need a conversion to be usefull.
As for example, this is the import string for a card (derived from this wiki list):
</p><p>CardList.Add("Ancient Elf", New CardItem("Ancient Elf", CardFaction.Gods, 5, 26, 3150, 7980, 3500, 8640, 6.56, 7.1, 13.65, 21300, "Great hit to foe's demons ATK"))
</p><p>And there is an entry for every ability:
</p><p>SkillEffectList.Add("Big boost to man DEF", New CardSkillEffect(0.13, CardSkillEffect.Affected.Man, CardSkillEffect.Applicability.DEF, CardSkillEffect.Type.Inc))
</p><p>I have an xls sheet to convert from wiki list.
</p><p>Your idea about hashcode is great. I will work on it asap.
</p>

<p>As some skills do not influence your atk/def, but the oponent, it would be interesting to take that into account.
-10% to opponent's skills can be reincorporated into your stats as a +11.11% no? (I haven't read the entire page so I don't know the formulas...)
Also as some stats are realm dependent, you could show an atk/def value different against each realm...

<p>Has anyone tested to see how much extra damage wall boosters did?
I'm expecting it to be higher than the normal big boost (if not I don't see the point, might as well keep your usual deck)
In that case it would be nice to have the figures

<p>I ran a test to determine if a buff from a defender would be calculated using the deck's base value (outcome 1), or if it would be calculated using the base value with debuffs applied (outcome 2). To do this, I created a scenario with two simple cards using "all" skills. The defense card has one single defense point higher than the attack card. Both players are using non-realm cards and have no other bonuses applied. 
</p><p>Attacker 
Card: Goblin Fighter (R) 
Attack: 2866 
Skill: [Rage] Medium hit to foe's DEF (all) 
</p><p>Defender 
Card: High lancer 
Defense: 2867 
Skill: [Lightning Lance] Medium boost to DEF (all) 
</p><p>If outcome 1 is true, then the defense value should be identical and the defender will win. If outcome 2 is true, the resulting defense value should be slightly lower, and the attacker should win. 
In the test, the defender won proving that the defender's buffs are not calculated using the debuffed base value.

<p>I noticed that skill percentages went up so I decided to test with Nightmare, Zombie Rider, and Demonic Knight.
</p><p>Take Nightmare for example. Atk is 15,402 I am an order leader and have 7% construct bonus. Total 12% My Nightmare is skill 10 and have realm bonus. I battled someone with no defense and ended up with atk 22,152.
</p><p>So it's just math. 15,402(x)=22,152 22,152/15,402=x x=1.44 (rounded). So that is 44% difference. 44%-5%(realm)-5%(order leader)-7%(construct)= 27% This tells me Nightmare is NOT 13%. It is 16% with skill 1 being 17%. Additional skills increase by 1%, skill 9 is 25%. Just add skill to the baseline of 16%. Skill 10 however is 2% more.
</p><p>I also tested this with Demonic Knight and Zombie Rider. Both the same way. In conclusion. Big boost to realm is 16%, big boost to 2 realm is 12%, and big boost to all is 10%.
</p><p>Wiki needs to change all skill percentages accordingly. Please test this out for yourselves and test great boosts out please.

<p>I did the test with Pan and it clearly showed 10% increase.  I've noticed that the chart has since been changed to 11%.  Can someone else verify this?  I don't see the data that was used to come up with 11% boost on Big boost to 2 realms.  Thanks.

<dl><dd> Ok.  Just re-ran the test.  Pan is sk 5 at 17544 ATK.  No other boost applied (no realm, construct, etc.).  End ATK was 20001 which is 14.004787961696309 boost to Pan.  At skill 5, that's 10 + 4 = 14%.  Rounding up at 14.004787961696309 to 15% wouldn't be accurate, unless the percentage is more the higher the skill level.</dd></dl>

<p>Since the introduction of superevolving, no data has been added on skill levels greater than 10. Preliminary tests suggest that, unlike skill levels 1-10, the percent boost for higher levels depends on either the rarity of the FF card or the size of the skill (I suspect the latter, but since they usually amount to the same thing I haven't had a chance to test any of the unusual cases). Also note that these tests were done using a single atk-boost or atk/def-boost card; there is no reason to believe that the percentages will be different for defense boosts or hit to foe's atk or def, but these haven't been tested. Raw data can be posted on request.

<p>Methodology: Ensure that raid boss animations are turned on. Attack a raid boss with 1 AP using a 1-card event deck, with the appropriate skill card in the leader position of group 1 and no other cards. Depending on the card's HP, it will get 1-5 hits on the boss before dying or ending in a draw. Record the damage for each hit, as well as whether or not the skill activated. Also record whether or not rising break was active, whether or not atk boost activated, and the combo multiplier (when applicable). For each hit, divide by the combo multiplier, 1.2 for atk boost, and 2 for rising break; the result is the base damage with/without skill. If the skill hits too often to get a good sample of no-skill hits, put the card into position 2 of the event deck, with nothing in the leader position.
</p><p>With a sufficiently large number of trials, you'll observe that there are six distinct values for damage without skill and six with skill. When these two groups are ranked, the ratios of each pair (ie, lowest with skill to lowest without skill, #2 with to #2 without, etc.) will be the same - this is the damage multiplier for that boss, skill, and skill level.
</p><p>The following data were collected during Ice Throne, using cards with both general-raid-boss and Ice-Throne-specific skills as noted. All bosses were of the three common types; Awakened Pluto and Hatecraft Hades were observed to take more damage with the same card, though it is not yet known whether or not the ratio remains the same.
</p><p>Additional tests ongoing; anyone who wants to help, please add as much data as you can. In particular, it is important to determine whether or not general vs specific skills and unevolved vs evolved cards influence the results.
