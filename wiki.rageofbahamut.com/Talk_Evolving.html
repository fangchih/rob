<p>I just updated the first half of the evolution page. I added pictures and changed the text to be more clear. And I removed some mistakes.
</p>
<ul><li> There was something written about factor 1.1, 1.29 etc. for evolving forms and lilith given as an example. I checked it ingame. It was wrong. I deleted this part.</li>
<li> This "Pair" stuff will be completely removed from this page, when I do the 2nd update. Because: It is only used in Jap. Version. It is confusing, because final form is no Pair at all. "Number of base cards" is far more usefull, easier to understand and used in our version</li>
<li> The person who tried to move the data from the japanese wiki, missunderstood the jap wiki text. "2 before" has nothing to do with 4-3, 6-3 etc. It is something like a 8-13, 6-9, where you dont MAX 2 base cards. Doesn't matter, because it is not used in our Version is more a individuall strategy. Actually the "straight" evos are the 6-3, 4-3 etc. evos and not the 6-7, 4-5 evos. So this is/was mixed up and will be changed.</li>
<li> On the 2nd update I will replace the evolution pictures with more consistent pictures and I try to make this part more compact. At the moment you have to scroll like stupid. Quite annoying to read this part.</li></ul>

</p><p>Is the ATK/DEF gain(from Enhancement) bound by card/form/rarity? Is there an easy way to calculate the ATK/DEF values up to end form for each card for evolving strategies like 8full? --anon
</p><p>Yes, I just confirmed it with 2 Cu Sith's in game.  Attack was 508 after evolving which is 468(base of Cu Sith+) + 20(5% of Cu Sith) + 20(5% of Cu Sith)--<a href="User_Echocrash.html" title="User:Echocrash">Echocrash</a> 02:21, 8 May 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>Yeah should be.  I went with the base stats on the japanese wiki as well as the in game archive.  I assume that if you evolve to +, it takes the 5 or 10% from each first stage, and adds that amount on to the base stats from + stage, which would be 120% + evolve carry-over bonus--<a href="User_Echocrash.html" title="User:Echocrash">Echocrash</a> 02:16, 8 May 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>Hey, just a question, so does that mean that Base = Base+ is 100% = 120% and an additional of either 5% or 10% each from the card's maturity? --<a href="User_Mr_Grunt.html" title="User:Mr Grunt">Mr Grunt</a> 01:18, 8 May 2012 (CDT)
</p><p><br />
Yes. The base stats get scaled by 1.2(lv2), 1.4(lv3) &amp; 1.8(lv4). Same with the difference of stat minus base stat. (Max-base)scaled. These values are the cards enhancement potential. which will carry over 5% of base or 10% of max.
</p><p>Here are a couple scenarios with alberich:
note: 6-2 refers to 6 cards , enhancing both lvl 3 cards
note 2: These ratios are close for most cards with minor variance
note 3: A 4-0 has none of the cards evolved except the final one. So the card will page will show the non enhance number.

<p>Just a little something which could be worth mentioning on this page about how the percentage of stats retained play out. For example, if you start with 2 T1 cards, enhance them and then evolve them together, we know that 10% of it's stats will be retained. This means that we have the bases stats + 10% + 10%. That's where percentage math throws a curve ball. A percentage of a percentage in the vast majority of games is usually a bad deal and RoB is no exception to this rule. This is because this 10% retained stats itself is only represents a fraction of the stats of the new cards and that fraction if multiplied by another fraction. Let's pretend for simplicity sake that that the retained stats represent 10% of the total stats of the new card. If you evolve it again, the stats retained from the T1 card will be... 10% of 10% which really means that only about 1% of the stats gained during the first evolve are retained during the second evolve. The same phenomenon happens during the third evolve.
</p><p>There's only about a 0.1% gain to be had from evolving a T1 card on the final T4, about 1% from a T2. The T3 gets the full 10% as it's the last in line. Keep in mind, my numbers are not exact, but they do give a good idea of what happens. The stats retained from enhancing a T1 and T2 are questionable at best and only really worth it if you are going for the big one.

<pre>

== Description ==

Evolution is when you use 2 of the same cards to merge, causing it to evolve to the next form (Up to the 4th stage). &lt;br/&gt;
Evolving will retain 5% or 10% when fully [[maturing|matured]] of the card's stats and add on to the next stage's stats.&lt;br&gt;
If the retained boost results in a floating-point number, the result will be rounded up.&lt;br&gt;
In case of a [[Bunny Lilith Limil]] with 5063 ATK at max level, the exact result should be 506.3,but values will be rounded up to 507.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Notes about Evolving to keep in mind:
&lt;br&gt;
If the Base card is considered to be 100%, Base+ is 120%, Base++ is 140%, and Final is 180%
&lt;br&gt;
An example of this is [[Cu Sith]], whose attack stats are: 390, 468, 546, and 702
&lt;br&gt;
Cu Sith is 390&lt;br&gt;
Cu Sith+ is 468, which is 390*1.2, or +20%&lt;br&gt;
Cu Sith++ is 546 which is 390*1.4 or +40%&lt;br&gt;
[Mad Dog] Cu Sith is 702 which is 390*1.8 or +80%&lt;br&gt;

The Japanese Wiki states that there are several common Evolving Patterns to consider&lt;br&gt;
8Full (Requires [[Enhancing]] all 15 stages from tier 1 to the last tiers)&lt;br&gt;
8Straight (Requires Enhancing only the 7 stages from tier 2 to the last tiers)&lt;br&gt;
8-2Before (Requires Enhancing only the 3 stages from tier 3 and the last tiers)&lt;br&gt;
8Normal (Requires Enhancing only at the last tier)&lt;br&gt;
6Full (Requires Enhancing all 11 stages from tier 1 to the last tiers)&lt;br&gt;
6Straight (Requires Enhancing all 7 stages from tier 2 to the last tiers)&lt;br&gt;
6-2Before (Requires Enhancing only the 3 stages from tier 3 and the last tiers)&lt;br&gt;
6Normal (Requires Enhancing only at the last tier)&lt;br&gt;
5Custom (Requires Enhancing all 7 stages from tier 1 to the last tiers)&lt;br&gt;
4Full (Requires Enhancing all 7 stages from tier 1 to the last tiers)&lt;br&gt;
4Custom (Requires Enhancing only the 3 stages from tier 3 and the last tiers)&lt;br&gt;
4Normal (Requires Enhancing only at the last tier)


In terms of final results, in descending order:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

8-Full &gt; 8-Straight &gt; 6-Full &gt; 6-Straight &gt; 5-Custom &gt; 8-2Before &gt; 6-2Before &gt; 4-Full &gt; 4-Custom &gt; 8-Normal &gt; 6-Normal &gt; 4-Normal&lt;br&gt;
The difference between 8-Full and 6-Straight is 0.52%.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

8-Full: 100% Efficient&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;Enhance everything, throughout all stages
Recommended for your best of the best, only do this if the card needs to be as perfect as can be.</pre><br />
<p>8-Straight: 99.70% Efficient<br />
</p>
<pre>Don't enhance the first stage, but enhance everything for +, ++, and Final. (Saves Enhancing 8 times, but weaker than 8Full)
Recommended for HR and SR, where you have a decent supply, but want more power without fully committing.</pre><br />
<p>8-2Before: 97.87% Efficient<br />
</p>
<pre>Don't enhance anything until the 2 ++'s and Final. (Saves a ton on enhancing, but as a result is a lot weaker.)
Recommended for R and HR, where you have a large supply but dont want to waste a ton of resources enhancing.</pre><br />
<p>8-Normal: 87.21% Efficient<br />
</p>
<pre>Standard 8 card evolve, but only enhancing the final stage. (Only need to enhance 1 thing, but very weak.)
Never do this, unless for N or HN</pre><br />
<p>6-Full: 99.63% Efficient<br />
</p>
<pre>As with 8Full, enhance everything.(Essentially on par with 8Straight. 2 Cards or 4 max enhances, your choice.  
Probably a good idea if the cards are very expensive but you can enhance them for a cheaper cost.)
Recommended for HR and SR</pre><br />
<p>6-Straight: 99.48% Efficient<br />
</p>
<pre>Don't enhance 4 of the first stage. The 4 that are used to make the 2 +'s. Then enhance both +'s and both first stages used to make the 2 ++'s.  
Enhance those and then the final for 7 total enhances.(Saves 2 cards and less enhancing but weaker than 6Full)
Recommended for R and HR</pre><br />
<p>5-Custom: 98.43% Efficient<br />
</p>
<pre>Make a + without enhancing the first stages. Enhance the + and evolve with an enhanced first stage for a ++.
Then make a + by enhancing both first stages. 
Enhance this + and evolve with the enhanced ++ for the final stage for 7 total enhances. (Save 1 card, but weaker than 6Straight)
Recommended for R and HR</pre><br />
<pre>Below is the simpler break down of how it is.


=== 4 Card Evolve ===

Base(1) + Base(2) = Base+(1)&lt;br&gt;
Base+(1) + Base(3) = Base++(1)&lt;br&gt;
Base++(1) + Base(4) = Final&lt;br&gt;

Base+(1) + Base(5) = Base++(1)&lt;br&gt;
Base++(1) + Base+(1) = Final&lt;br&gt;

or&lt;br&gt; (weaker if using Base, instead of Base+, for Final form)

Base(1) + Base(2) = Base+(1)&lt;br&gt;
Base(3) + Base(4) = Base+(2)&lt;br&gt;
Base+(1) + Base+(2) = Base++(1)&lt;br&gt;

Base(4) + Base(5) = Base+(2)&lt;br&gt;
Base+(2) + Base(6) = Base++(2)&lt;br&gt;
Base++(1) + Base++(2) = Final&lt;br&gt;

or&lt;br&gt;

Base(1) + Base(2) = Base+(1)&lt;br&gt;
Base(3) + Base(4) = Base+(2)&lt;br&gt;
Base(5) + Base(6) = Base+(3)&lt;br&gt;
Base+(1) + Base+(2) = Base++(1)&lt;br&gt;
Base++(1) + Base+(3) = Final&lt;br&gt;

=== 7 Card Evolve ===

Base(1) + Base(2) = Base+(1)&lt;br&gt;
Base(3) + Base(4) = Base+(2)&lt;br&gt;
Base(5) + Base(6) = Base+(3)&lt;br&gt;
Base+(1) + Base+(2) = Base++(1)&lt;br&gt;
Base+(3) + Base(7) = Base++(2)&lt;br&gt;
Base++(1) + Base++(2) = Final&lt;br&gt;


=== 8 Card Evolve ===

Base(1) + Base(2) = Base+(1)&lt;br&gt;
Base(3) + Base(4) = Base+(2)&lt;br&gt;
Base(5) + Base(6) = Base+(3)&lt;br&gt;
Base(7) + Base(8) = Base+(4)&lt;br&gt;
Base+(1) + Base+(2) = Base++(1)&lt;br&gt;
Base+(3) + Base+(4) = Base++(2)&lt;br&gt;
Base++(1) + Base++(2) = Final</pre>

<p>Just a discussion:  Why are stratergies of enhancing and evolving that are 95% effecient "not recommended?"  Enhancing a rare card takes at least 200 feeder cards and lord knows how many rupies if you do it effeciently but are unlucky and don't get excellent enhances.  (10x4 on 1st enhance gets to level 16,  10x4 on second to level 24, etc.)  Pursuing the final 5% to get a card to its full potential should be "not recommended."
