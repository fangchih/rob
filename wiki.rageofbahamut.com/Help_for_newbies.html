If you don't use one you miss out on a free <a href="Maid_Seria.html" title="Maid Seria">Maid Seria</a>  (rare). Note that depending on the time you enter the referral code, the rewards may vary accordingly.
Set a timer for the about the same as the amount of stamina you have. You can be more efficient if you frequently log in when you first start out. Just a point here, I didn't use a referral code and in three days I amassed over 50K rupies and have over 35 different card types. As well as a battle history of 18W 2L. Also completed a treasure set. Not gloating or bragging, I have not been on my game EVERY time my stamina was full, I could have done much more, but I chose sleep and homework over constant work on the game.
</p><p>You do not have to spend money, but it can help.
Rage medals cost actual money but the great thing about RoB is that all the cards can be earned <b>in game.</b>
If you intend to use rage medals, go for enough to get the bundled 6 legend card pack. Not only does it save you the cost of 1 of the legend card packs, but you also get 6 holy powders. Very useful for events, or treasure completion runs.
</p><p>Store your cure waters and holy powders for events.
If your not putting money into the game to get these they are hard to come by and every edge in an event helps.
</p><p>Card farm and rupie farm.
Don't forget you can go back to previous quest areas. Scroll down on whatever quest area you are on and you can select any of the available quest areas. If one of the cards you need more of is in a certain quest battle, keep playing it to get that card. You can get your tier 4 cards easily this way. You can also evolve cards to tier 4 and <a href="Enchanting.html#Feeder" title="Enchanting" class="mw-redirect">feed</a> them to stronger cards to enhance those further.
</p><p>It's good to enhance cards, but much better to evolve them. It takes a lot of cards to get your cards enhanced to the max level, but evolving is easier and cheaper, and will boost your card's stats much more efficiently. The only downside is that to get a tier 4 card, you need 4 of a kind of that card, which can be hard to come by (especially with rares). A bonus is that with evolving, your cards have much better stats, while still requiring the same amount of attack power.
</p><p>Set up a trade list. Let people know what cards you're looking for and what you're willing to do to get them. If someone has a card you would like, don't be afraid to request a trade, the worst they can do is refuse it. Just remember don't offer normal cards for rare or above. A good rule of thumb is same rarity for same rarity, multiple of one step below, or one from one step above (if possible).
</p><p>Best way to build friendship points. Don't just send support to a few every couple hours, if you want to maximize your friendship point gain send your support to your fellows first. Then go to user search and type in a single letter, support someone, click on another user who supported them and support that person, keep this up until you run into a point where you have to go back to user search. You can send your daily 500 supports this way and net much more. Each support counts as one whether you send a message or not ask yourself, is it better to earn a lot more friendship points by only sending support with a message or not?
</p><p>When an event comes around, find an order and join. Some orders will carry newbies through the event. You can gain quite a few friendship points and other bonuses just by being part of an order.
</p><p>Setup a Twitter account. Right now there is a promotion for posting on Twitter daily. Four hundred friendship points and five thousand rupies per day, plus ever ten days you will earn an Angel Queen. Well worth the hassle.
</p><p>Enhance before evolve. When you evolve any cards to their next tier they will retain 5% of their stats; however if you level them up to their max level before evolving, they will retain 10% of their stats.
Card Max levels are based by rarity and listed below.
</p><p>Normal-lvl 20
High Normal-lvl 30
Rare-lvl 40
High Rare-lvl 50
SR-lvl 60
SSR-lvl 70
Legendary-lvl 80
(This list was posted on Gamefaqs.com by user Coeus10)
You could also level up the third tier and the first tier that you are going to evolve together for your fourth tier. It still gets you close to the same stats without burning a lot of rupies.
</p><p>Just for an idea I have heard of High Rares going in trades for about 20 Holy Powder and up. Offer anything less and some users will just laugh at you.
</p><p><br />
Most importantly have fun.
</p><p>(This guide is not "all inclusive" and as for the moment is incomplete. Any suggestions for addition please feel free to add, but understand that if you do add anything that isn't yours to begin with give credit to where it is due.)

<p>Rage of Bahamut has become more rookie-friendly and after playing as a newbie for a few days I've decided to add a few things. First, if you somehow stumbled upon this page before completing the tutorial, use a referral code as stated above. I haven't tried it but in theory you can use a random code and hope it works. Or you can obtain one from friends or use my code: "myw69305". Doing so will net you handsome rewards. <b>NOTE:</b> If you haven't installed the game yet, do so just after the daily reset at 6am ET. Why? We'll discuss that later.
</p><p>Whether or not you used a referral code, after the 3rd and 4th quest you'll get 2 identical S-rare cards(<a href="Zirnitra.html" title="Zirnitra">Zirnitra</a>, <a href="Urd.html" title="Urd">Urd</a>, <a href="Percival.html" title="Percival">Percival</a>) depending on your chosen realm. For simplicity I will refer to said cards as Zirnitra as it is my chosen realm (Demons).
Evolve Zirnitra to its final form and enhance it to max lvl using the cards received IN QUESTS (WARNING: DO NOT USE THE S-RARE CARD RECEIVED FOR COMPLETING THE TUTORIAL). In case you haven't noticed it, you'll have unlimited stamina until you reach lvl20. This means you should only increase your atk points.
</p><p>Remember to get the daily free friendship CP as it gives 10 cards for the first three days. To maximize your archive bonus evolve the cards received to the final form (not necessary).
</p><p><b>Important tips:</b> Don't rush to level 20 for the free claim ticket. Instead, go to the battle screen and find opponents higher level than you. Choose the ones with 10 DEF PWR. Now, don't start battle immediately. First go to Edit Deck &gt;&gt; ATK Deck I (any empty ATK deck will do) and place only one card in there -your max enhanced Zirnitra. Increase priority and go back to battle. Now you can battle him and win. Keep doing so until your ATK PWR is too low, then lvl up to refill then repeat. I don't use holy powders but if you want to then it's alright as long as you only use mini-holy powder and personal holy powder. DO NOT use the normal ones. Keep repeating the process until lvl 20 and increasing only ATK PWR each time. Within the first day (technically, the first day in my timezone), I got over 500k rupies (maybe a lot more, I never kept track). This attack technique guarantees a win each time. As of day 10, I have a battle history of 500W 1L (the Loss was when I accidentally attacked someone with 10DEF without noticing I only had 9ATK PWR left). 
</p><p>Now, I mentioned earlier that you should start your game just after the reset. This maximizes the amount of play time you have for the 3-day Rookie Battle Ranking. Using the above attack technique I got ranked at 48 in 2 days because I started playing around 1 hour before reset.
</p><p>If you log in frequently throughout the day, I recommend you stop at an ATK PWR of 70 and increase stamina to 100+. Then the rest is up to you. <b>Edit:</b> If you plan on playing event quests I highly recommend you get at least 100 ATK for the boost during raid bosses.
</p><p>Thanks for reading. Have fun!
