<p>When i click cardlist it only displays the cards up untill Ariton. It also only displays a few when i click a realm.<br />
I am also unable to sort the table in anyway i.e sort cards by skill effect. There is no link to click on.<br />
It seems the be a Holland problem as thats where i am from and my friends have the same problem.
I have had this problem before but after a few days it was solved automatically. It has now been more than a week and getting annoying!

<dl><dd> Hey, thx for your message. No it's not just a "Holland Problem" it's a problem with the wiki. Wiki is running out of space. This also produces your described problems. At the moment we are trying to get into contact with the Admins/owner of this side, since they all seem to have retired. Until now we didn't have any success, but hopefully we'll get the problems solved.&#160;:( --<a href="User_Morgan.html" title="User:Morgan">Morgan</a> (<a href="User_talk_Morgan.html" title="User talk:Morgan">talk</a>) 07:49, 19 January 2014 (EST)</dd></dl>

<p>Hey Morgan, I've been trying to get into robforums to reply to your thread there lol but it seems like they have mail issues (can't get my verification email).   Anyway an update is I've talked to Ezo the past week, and he sees the problem, he fixed it very temporarily but was looking into a long term fix.  The site itself is fine for space, it's a partition issue for the temp rendering currently.

<p>It means for raw data, permanent images, etc... there's TONS of room... but each page is built temporarily in a temp cache, along with each thumbnail image, etc... that's on a separate partition if I understood correctly... and that's where the bottleneck currently is.   I've sent another email letting him know the issues have gotten worse with pages not rendering completely and soforth. ^^

<p>How you do suppose we should add traits to the card info pages? There's a lot of info to be collected and added to the wiki in a nice format.

<p>So I added Traits to a few cards that had been converted over to the new page style, easy stuff, then I took a crack at editing a page, Archdaemon. Not sure where I went wrong, but I previewed my changes and something failed. So I just want to know how to not do this again, and how to go about it the right way without wasting 15 minutes copying and pasting information and having it all for naught. I didn't save the edit by the way just left it alone, but this is what I came up with:

<p>I am looking for volunteers to get me smartphone-sized images of each form for cards that are either exclusive to the international version of RoB or have a different rarity (and hence, different borders) from the Japanese version. If you can edit the images and upload them to the wiki yourself, that would be great. If you would rather have me do that, hit me up on LINE @ cthawke and I'll work on the images. Thanks!
</p><p>The ones I need help most with are Legend cards. Those are pesky, and not to mention, expensive.

I cannot get to the formula using what my deck hits for in game and using backwards math. 
Is this something that is being researched for addition to the wiki?
