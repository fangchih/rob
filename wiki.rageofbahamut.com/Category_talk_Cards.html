<p>If you are having issues with the evolution stats, please verify that card was properly evolved by checking the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Evolving.html">evolving page</a>. If you are still getting conflicting data, complete the following table.

</p><p>Note <b><a href="Mina.html" title="Mina">Mina</a></b> will need a larger table than below(modify accordingly), if enhancement bonus gained is only based on the carry over,there is no need to list all 18 cards before ff. Evo table will probably be 19 card - 36 card  data (only some values, not all) and i don't see a large benefit in using 36 cards (I'm guessing 19 card evo will be most cost effective and 36 card evo won't be much stronger than 19 card evo) (sorry haven't looked at data).

Okay, evolution page has been updated. I think about making a java script app, to make adding cards to the wiki easier: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tinyurl.com/feedercalc">Click on WIKI card</a>. Atm it simply calculates the lvl1 stats of different evo forms. But I could change it to some input fields and listboxes which will automatically create a template in the white box at the bottom. People can copy the code from there, to the wiki.
</p>
<hr />
<p>[18/10/2012] @Svtanthony: There are already pages, which can do similiar calculations like that: 
</p>
<ul><li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://sites.google.com/site/gamingank/home/rage-of-bahamut/atk-def-stat-calc">https://sites.google.com/site/gamingank/home/rage-of-bahamut/atk-def-stat-calc</a></li>
<li> <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://robstat.mywebcommunity.org/">http://robstat.mywebcommunity.org/</a></li>
<li> Or do you want to create a wiki page, which is able to do sth like that? That would be cool ^^.</li></ul>
<hr />
<p>[16/10/2012] I played around with the evo trees and I am still not sure what is the best way. At the moment they look [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Evolving.html#Base_cards_used">like this</a>] without max cards. Some thoughts:
</p>
<ul><li> the picture shouldnt contain too much tiny details, because you should be able to read it in those small thumbnail pictures (they are quite small). Adding too big pictures would make the evo page look quite large and confusing.
<ul><li> I thought about changing the strukture, by adding a table for every number of base cards, which contains all 4 pictures. Example: "6 cards"-chapter will contain a table with 4-1, 4-3, 4-5, 4-7 pictures side by side to save page space. They will still appear in the table of contents by using the &quot;&lt;h4&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&quot; command (thanks to Ezo for changing the template, that is how I learned about this feature today ^^)</li></ul></li>
<li> People usually read from top to bottom. so the base cards will be at top and the final form at the bottom of the evo trees. That is how all those evo-trees are displayed in the forums etc.</li>
<li> I thought about adding the numbering only to the black max enhanced cards, to show how many MAX cards are used. But I think I simply delete the numbers. I will simply add a big "MAX" to those cards.</li>
<li> about the difference between top and bottom of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="File_Evo_tree.html">6-3</a>
<ul><li> Actually, the bottom picture is more correct, because it seperates the tiers correctly. But about 99% of the peoples who know all those evo trees, dont understand what those tiers mean and why tiers which are near to the final form have a bigger effect to the FF when MAX enhanced.</li>
<li> Maybee I will really change this tiersystem to a 1.row = base, 2.row = +, 3.row = ++, 4.row = base system. But evos like 4-X and 5-X will look pretty messed up this way. And max enhanced card will appear in the top row while the other max enhanced cards are somewhere else at the bottom <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="images/archive/6/67/20121016221906%21Evo_tree5.png">Quick example of the "problems"</a></li>
<li> Maybe I gonna stick to the old tier system, but simply highlight the base cards. I gonna think about this. It is hard to think like a noob again, who sees those pictures for the first time. The only thing I remember is, that it sucked, when I was a noob, that noone highlighted the base cards in those evo trees.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>compare card stats table:<br />
I read something about those templates you make and added some attributes to your to be able to make a  <a href="User_Ecksofa.html" title="User:Ecksofa">list with evo stats</a>. But many card pages have to be resaved, because their values are missing at the moment. But I think, this page can be ultra usefull to compare stats of different cards faster. In the past in used <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://sites.google.com/site/gamingank/home/rage-of-bahamut/card-build-stats">Anks table</a> therefore, but it is not up to date anymore.  - Ecksofa
</p>
<hr />
<p>[15/10/2012] @ Ecksofa: I really liked the way you displayed the evolution charts, specifically the 6-3 top <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="File_Evo_tree.html">6-3</a>, where the cards are separated by tier. Adding the max term is useful and the numbering I never really cared either way ( i assumed it was the base cards, then subsequent evolution , but the didn't hold true for all) . You definitely have a winner with the layout and the coloring!!! 
</p>
<dl><dd> I'll put something together for the additional fields to be displayed. Maybe making a calculator page(if possible, where you choose the Card, Tier, # of Cards, # of Enhancements and it can calculate the stats. Only thing needed would be a drop down of the cards that can be calculated, and to see if the site can calculate on the fly. All evo data is pre-calculated, which is why the site goes down when a change is made that has to recalculate data.   --<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> (<a href="User_talk_Svtanthony.html" title="User talk:Svtanthony">talk</a>) 21:31, 15 October 2012 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<hr />
<p>[11/10/2012] @Svtanthony: 
</p>
<ul><li> Hm, a table with columns for lvl 1 and max stats for each not final form evo would be great, but this would only work well with the old nomenclature, I guess&#160;:P. So I think, we shuld stick with maxed cards first. </li>
<li> I think the {{PAGENAME}} variable could be useful in this case. </li>
<li> Maybe we could make pictures for every of those not final form evos aswell. I think those evo pictures should be changed anyway. 
<ul><li> At the moment they are numbered from tree bottom to tree top. I think to understand this new nomenclature better the numbering should be the otherway around. That would make more clear which cards have to be maxed. Actually, I have no clue, what this numbering is for at them moment. I never understood this part. Would have been more clear without them.</li>
<li> MAX should be added to the card pictures to make the picture understandable without searching for "wtf is black and white card". At least I had to do this, when i found this page for the first time.</li>
<li> The tree structure is not very consistent and symmetric in my opinion. Here are 2 examples of what i would prefer (made in open office draw, easy to modify) [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="File_Evo_tree.html">6-3 example</a>] [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="File_Evo_tree2.html">8-3 example</a>]</li>
<li> maybe the base card could get a grey frame or other color emphasizing, to make it more clear, that the 8 of 8-3 refers to the base cards. [<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="File_Evo_tree3.html">8-3 colored base cards </a>]</li>
<li> I could make those pictures for all evos during this week, if interested.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>[11/10/2012]@ Ecksofa: I agree about the combined field "8-15" and I'll make the changes to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Evolving.html">Evolving Page</a> and subsequently to the tables. I also agree with your dislike of the "full", "straight", etc, nomenclature. I'll make the needed changes tomorrow night.  
</p><p>On the Card base , the stats are in the card definitions, but i could easily build a table for the Card+((2*2)-1 = 3 rows) &amp; Card ++ ((4*2)-1 = 7 Rows + 3*2-1... = 5 rows = 12 rows total) (thinking out loud), so yeah i'll need to see which of the 12 rows are more useful because having such granular data might be a little too much for some people. Let me know if you have any suggestions on the layout or what data to display. --<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> (<a href="User_talk_Svtanthony.html" title="User talk:Svtanthony">talk</a>) 19:08, 11 October 2012 (UTC) 
</p>
<hr />
<p>[11/10/2012] @Svtanthony: Okay, I think I am not able to convince you&#160;:(. I still absolutely dislike this new nomenclature, but fine. 
</p><p>I really like those new links to the evo page. But I have some possible improvements for this and the evopage:
</p>
<ul><li> We should not use "full", "straight" etc, because they are not used at all in our english version. And I even dislike this nomenclature more than the new one, because it feels incomplete and even harder to understand for beginners. But the most important point is: noone uses it here and there is no need for it.</li>
<li> Actually, we should change the Evo section names on the <a href="Evolution.html" title="Evolution" class="mw-redirect">Evolution</a> page to "6-7" "4-6" etc because people who start this game want to look up stuff like "what is a 6-7" and instead they find "6straight", what they have never heard of before. But you have to do this section-renaming change, because otherwise I break the links on your evo-table-template (I didnt found out, in which template I could change it ^^).</li>
<li> atm there are 2 colums. 1. card number 2. enhancement number, but noone will sort them by enhancements i guess. could we make a single column of this with "8-15" written in it instead of this split up "8" "15". Then the links to the evo page would not look that odd either, like they do at the moment. example:</li></ul>

<p><br />
[11/10/2012] @Ecksofa -  sorry for the late response, I'm inundated with work and homework
</p><p>1) Newer naming accounts for all costs and accounts for a maxed final form , where Before naming assumes the final form to be maxed, but not everyone will make that assumption, making the newer naming more representative of whats occurring. Playing semantics&#160;: a 4-6(before) could be level 1 to max , but in essence it's an incomplete 4-7(newer).  
</p><p>2) I agree that having 2 naming conventions is confusing at times, but I didn't want to use an inaccurate convention simply because it was established. to remedy this:
</p>
<dl><dd>A) lets just refer to the newer nomenclature</dd>
<dd>B) evolution tables have been linked to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Evolving.html">Evolving Page</a> to see the proper way to evolve </dd>
<dd>C) I have added "Total" to the evolution table title.</dd>
<dd>D) we could change the branding on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="Evolving.html">Evolving Page</a> , to read <b>cards</b>/<b>enhancements</b> in lieu of "full","straight, etc.</dd></dl>
<p><br />

</p>
<dl><dd>A) Not true - For example: an un-enhanced card will be a 4-0(newer), where with the older naming it would technically be a 4-(-1) because a 4-0(older) assumes an enhancement, but I've seen those evolutions referred to as an un-enhanced 4-0(older) .</dd></dl>

<p>The evo formulas should work with all but mina and future referral cards. In terms of naming convention for the evos (cards and total enhancements) . I'm not sure why people refer to cards as (cards &amp; enhancements before ff). If you are doubting that a card enhancement has minimal impacts , you'll be surprised. For example (5480 *10%) = Lv 2 * 10% ....  yields a cards impact as 5480 *10%*10%*10% = 5.48, roughly looking at that number, if you account for 2 cards and rounding , 12 points sounds about right. If needed i can include more data in the tables or i can include&#160;%s that can be just applied to the max (8-14) of any card. --<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> (<a href="User_talk_Svtanthony.html" title="User talk:Svtanthony">talk</a>) 01:58, 2 October 2012 (UTC)

<p>@Svtanthony:
to answer your question, why ppl dont include the last max enhance, i gonna copy a post I made on the forum:
</p>
<ul><li>established nomenclature:</li></ul>
<dl><dd>When I say a card is 4-6. Then it can be lvl 1 or lvl 50 in its final form, that doesnt matter. It will be still the same 4-6 evo. The maximal possible final stats are defined. The final max enhance isnt taken into account in this nomenclature, because it is unimportant. </dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd> <b>Yes the levels beyond 4-6 don't matter because you are looking at the max , but the max is a 4-7 because it required another enhancement.</b></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul><li>new nomenclature (spread by wiki):</li></ul>
<dl><dd>When we use this new nomenclature, a 4-6 can be a 4-7 where you did not enhance final form. OR it can be a 4-5 with final form maxed. Those cards will have different max stats... They are not the same. This nomenclature is UNCLEAR. </dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><b>Number of max enhancements is (cards x 2) - 1. so a 4-7 is max possible enhancements . what is calculated is always ff max, so there shouldn't be any confusion, but rather it should be less confusing</b></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>PS: I would love to see this being changed on wiki card template. Actually, that was the reason, I avoided the wiki a long time and didnt distribue something to it, because this nomenclature used here, is being spread and confused with the old established nomenclature.

[10-02-2012]I see your point in terms of confusion, but I disagree. The nomenclature is very straight forward if you don't play semantics, but I'll consider changing the naming convention if i have sufficient reason to i.e. i'm convinced it's better. 
</p><p>Reasons:
</p><p>1) When looking at a cards stats, one will never look at the base stats but rather the max potential for certain evolutions. (how many cards do you see that are ff , but not max enhanced and would you acquire those?) 
</p><p>2) While it's true that the "before ff" naming existed, while coding and frankly talking about it, the new naming convention better represented what was happening. ( They both make certain assumptions that better labeling might clarify, but one assumption is enhancements before ff with a variety steps between ff and ff max, where the other is total enhancements including ff.)
</p><p>3) Further the older naming still makes another assumption. = enhancements before ff and that the <b>final form is maxed</b>. which effectively adds another enhancement.
</p><p>4) look at bold below your points.
</p><p>5) if its better to name these tables with the older naming and enough people agree, i'll make the required changes.

<ul><li>concerning 1):</li></ul>
<p>Yes, people will be only interested in the max potential for certain evolutions. You should not add the base stats of a "4-6" to the table. Those are not important. Actually I some times see evoed card, which have been max enhanced before final form and final form lvl1, but you are right. That is quite rare and not the comon trade.
</p><p>The last enhancement is different from the other enhancement, because it has absolutely no influence on the final form stats. When I make a "old 4-6" it can be lvl 1 or max. That doesnt matter, I would not call the lvl 1 4-6 and the maxed version of it 4-7. Because both of them are a "4-6". When I see "4-6", I know, how strong the card can be. It doesnt matter, whether it is max or lvl 1.
</p>
<ul><li>concerning 2):</li></ul>
<p>Actually, that is a BIG problem with both convention. When a beginner reads them, they get explained, that the first number is the amount of cards and the 2nd number the number of max enhancement. That is a very short and wrong explanation. A big better would be: "the 2nd number are the max enhancements directely before the final form". But that is still not enough to explain how a proper 6-4 is done. <br />
For example a 6-5 ("6-4") is just a shortcut for an absolutely defined way HOW those 6 cards are evolved with each other and WHICH cards have to be max enhanced. You can not simply combine 6 base cards to a final form card and max enhance 4 of them and hope you get a 6-4. When you dont know the correct evo tree, you will probably completly fail. Most people dont understand the evo pattern, a good example is the person who thought the table would be wrong, though it is absolutely correct. <br />
I think it would be a good idea to change the 1. column of the evo stats table to the evo name (4-2, etc.) and link every evo to a picture with HOW the evo is done. How the cards are combined and which are max. For example it could link to the matching paragraph in the Evolving Guide. But before this can be done, the evolution page needs some changes. Especially the pictures for the 4-X evos are pretty bad in my opinion. And the nomenclature explained there, is the one used in japanese ROB and not in our version. I think that would be a great help for beginners to understand what this evo exactly mean and how they get the stats in the table.
</p>
<ul><li>concerning 3):</li></ul>
<p>NO, that is the point, what I think, is so IMPORTANT and NICE with the old nomenclature: <br />
It doesnt include the final enhancement in the evo-name AND the card final form DOESNT have to be max enhanced either. So you can make a 4-6 card and it doesnt matter whether it is lvl 1 or max. In the same moment you reached the final form, it IS a 4-6. You can not change the evo anymore, the possible max stats are already defined by the evo path you have chosen. You could show me your lvl 1 or lvl 21 or lvl 50 4-6 card. I will ask "what evo is it" and you can answer "It is 4-6". This way I know how you made the card and what it max stats will be, when you finally max the last form. With the new nomenclature, you could say "It is lvl 21 atm, so it is a 4-6, when I max it, it will be a 4-7". Great, but a 4-6 can be also a max enhanced "old 4-5 evo". That is why I say, that this nomenclature is unclear and confusing. You will always have one name (example 4-6), for two different final form cards ("4-5" with last form maxed or "4-6" which hasnt been maxed yet).
</p>
<ul><li>concerning 4):</li></ul>
<p><b>Yes the levels beyond 4-6 don't matter because you are looking at the max , but the max is a 4-7 because it required another enhancement.</b><br />
The final form enhancment is very different from the other enhancements. The other enhancements define the possible max stats of final form, while the last enhancment is just something done, after you made the proper evo to reach those max stats.  The way you combine the cards and the way to enhance them BEFORE final form, THAT is the evo of the card. The final form enhancement has nothing to do with the evo process at all. I dont know how to explain it in a good way... sorry, hopefully it is clear, what I mean with evo in this context. EVOs like 4-6, 6-6, 6-2 explain the way the final form is created. The last enhancement, has nothing to do with that.
</p><p><b>Number of max enhancements is (cards x 2) - 1. so a 4-7 is max possible enhancements . what is calculated is always ff max, so there shouldn't be any confusion, but rather it should be less confusing</b><br />
When you always calculate ff max, this would mean, that with the new nomenclature, you dont have a name for a not maxed final form. 
</p>
<ul><li>concerning 5):</li></ul>
<p>I think many new player stick by this new nomenclature, because they find it here in the wiki. And I dont think, that people that dont like it, will post it here in the wiki. Actually, I ignored the wiki for a long time, because of the evo-nomenclature used here. And people that use the wiki, usually dont edit it, dont know how to edit it, may not even now, that there is a talk-page like this, where they are allowed to contribute sth.

<p>The efficiency ratios address the evolution and star parameters. I'm not too knowledgeable on the star parameter, but in my opinion it's a visual representation of rarity. But if you look at the ratio, mak power and the skill, you'll determine which cards are better.  Lets look at <a href="Titan.html" title="Titan">Titan</a> &amp; <a href="Ifrit.html" title="Ifrit">Ifrit</a> these 2 have a similar ratio. Titan has more atk and def. But the skill of ifrit gives god cards a 13% <a href="Boosts.html" title="Boosts" class="mw-redirect">Boosts</a> increase,  where titan gives a 13% decrease. Considering that more people chose God faction over Man faction, it's better to boost your God atk than to decrease the enemy Man def. The evolution formulas assume a even split for the parents 8-15 (means it enhances itself and the cards that are combined have 7 enhancements and so on) can already do most of the calculations you're looking for, the only field we would add is the star field. We could use this idea for comparison to modify the cardlist so that we can compare cards and sort based on desired values.

I would have no problem helping you guys populate all the missing fields that will be added. My idea is to have all the evolved forms of each base card listed in one table with varying enhancement/evolution data.
</p><p>As for the answers to your questions:
</p>

<dd>Base Card - Would be the name of the base card (see my spreadsheet above to see what I mean)</dd></dl>
<p>There are a few other fields, but I just want you guys to take a look and see what I did with the formulas I set, as mine is also a work in progress. (P.S.

The way to call this new formula is to use the formulas for the evolution (EVO4, then the number of cards, the number of enhancements, base atk or def, max atk or def, and atk or def var, which is calculated through the formulas. (I just need 2 multipliers for Hild and verify the stats for Princess)
</p>
<dl><dd>Here is the formula for what most call a 8-14 evolution.  " Evo4| 8 | 15 | '"def"' | '"maxdef"' | "defvar" " </dd>
<dd>Note that for ex 8-14 is misleading because thats the base value, the max value is 8-15, also the way the formula is set up, it will always assume that the furthest from the 4th level evolution is not evolved , thus 8-14 will have one of the lv1 cards un-enhanced. So it will be better if you included the final enhancement to the enhancements ie. a 4-0 is really a 4-1 etc. </dd></dl>
<p>Further a 5th evolution table has been added and will be called for 5th evolution cards. The formulas have been tested and are ready to go live. --<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> 11:05, 6 July 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[05/07/2012] We (brother and I) recreated the evolution formulas (mostly him) so that they can be called much easier and are a lot more powerful. There are now many multipliers that would permit referral card calculations. The formulas still need rounding and a few more switches. see <a href="Template_Evo5.html" title="Template:Evo5">Template:Evo5</a> and all its dependencies. Will have this all wrapped up by Thursday night or Friday morning. Additionally , these sets of functions calculate 5th level evolutions. Further details to come. BTW the difference between the old and the new cardsets is very noticable.

</p><p>[01/07/2012] Well, I could make the current formulas take in 12 multipliers for all cards, then we can use the same formulas for all. For std cards the atk , def,m axatk,and maxdef are all scaled by the same ratios only requiring 3 multipliers, where with referral cards the atk, def, maxatk, and maxdef all grow differently (thus 12 multipliers). 
</p>
<dl><dd>Nobunaga - does grow like a std card, but will be off by a 2 points at each lvl (not worth the effort with 99.98% accuracy.). </dd>
<dd>Princess - has enough data to get all 12 multipliers though 6 are the same as the other 6.</dd>
<dd>Lucy &amp; Hild - have 7 multipliers just need 5 more. If numbers could be provided i can finalize within a day.</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Bahamut &amp; Tiamat have 5th evo (other lv5 cards as well) , which can be calculated easily. Just add another layer of calculations. (multiplier = 2 for lv5).</dd></dl>

That might not be worth the effort though.--<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> 12:36, 29 June 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[29/06/2012] On the card <a href="Template_Cardset_test.html" title="Template:Cardset test">Template:Cardset test</a> the user must populate the source, but above we state diff acquisition options (true/false fields). I recognize that the user needs to enter the quests where you get the cards. But in terms of entries like "cardpack" we could obtain from the T/F fields. Just a suggestion.--<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> 04:07, 29 June 2012 (CDT)

</p><p>[27/06/2012] Is it possible to use "if" statements in this language? If so we could add an "Evolution Type" so that we can only apply the detailed calculations to the "std" evolution and only to cards that have both the base &amp; max values. That might go in line with the suggested fields below. That might also be needed for the atk to pwr ratios, I see your point to use the base damage, but using that approach, we we won't be comparing a std evolution vs non std evolution cards. Additionally, higher rarity cards tend to have a larger gap between base and max damage so that will underrate the higher rarity cards.--<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> 12:40, 27 June 2012 (CDT)

[27/06/2012] What about something like this
</p><p>Cardset

</p><p>Friendcard = yes

[27/06/2012] Yea, problem is that i don't know the best way to combine all those sources yet. I could make a template variable for every possible source, so we easily combine multiple sources. But im afraid that will become a variable jungle in the end. Arrays are harder to parse, and will probably bring typos. Does anyone else have an idea what to do with this? --<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> 11:20, 27 June 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[27/06/2012] I'm pretty new to the game but I was wondering if we could add more categories for how to obtain a card.  I see a bunch of cards that I want on here but there is no info on where they come from.  Right now there is a <a href="Quest_cards.html" title="Quest cards">Quest cards</a> list and a <a href="Treasure_Cards.html" title="Treasure Cards">Treasure Cards</a> list.  Can we add a list for Event cards and friendship cards, realm boosters, legend card packs, and any other sources I don't know of.  I know some of the cards come from more then one place but I think it would be nice to let people see where they have the option of getting it from, or letting people know what cards they have the possibility of getting out of a pack. <a href="User_Thegriffin2000.html" title="User:Thegriffin2000">Thegriffin2000</a> 10:41, 27 June 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[27/06/2012] Thanks, this is will be very helpful for the users! I agree on displaying the atk/def stats as well. Although i think it's safer to take them from the 1st card form, so the same ratio can be applied on treasure cards as well. I'll look in how we can make a custom table that's focused on comparing, so the <a href="Category_Cards.html" title="Category:Cards">Category:Cards</a> doesn't get too scary at first sight. --<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> 07:37, 27 June 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[27/06/2012] Finished all the evolutionary calculations.  What do you think, should we add the atk &amp; def to pwr factors to the card info? Refer to excel spreadsheet.--<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> 02:07, 27 June 2012 (CDT)

</p><p>[26/06/2012] I understand that the 8 max scalar and formula are equal. I think having a formula available, instead of solely the scalar, is that people can look into the formula, learn from it and maybe even improve it. I added some of the popular formulas inside the <a href="Template_Cardset_test.html" title="Template:Cardset test">cardset</a> <a class="external text" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Templates">template</a>. Clicking an unknown template from the edit/preview page automatically brings you to the create page.--<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> 17:41, 26 June 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[26/06/2012] Essentially what you coded and the scalar multiple are the same. Once all the cancellations are complete you'll end up multiplying by the scalar value. I corrected the <a href="index0449.html?title=Template:FormulaEvo8max&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Template:FormulaEvo8max (page does not exist)">Template:FormulaEvo8max</a> to have the increased accuracy calculations. But with a rounding error of +- 1 point versus the total attack, it becomes inconsequential. If you show me how to create a template for the formulas, i would code all the formulas that are needed.--<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> 15:51, 26 June 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[26/06/2012] Ah, a simplified scalar is nice to have, but i prefer to have the original formula available somewhere, to ensure the results validity/debugging. I did some quick testing with translating the formula to mediawiki, and it ended up not being so hard. I'll also try to keep my hands of the wiki for a few hours now, and continue those at work. --<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> 07:26, 26 June 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[26/06/2012] I simplified the 8 max to a very simple formula. took some algebraic analysis, but for an 8 card max evo the scalar value is 2.136 x maxatk1. Keep in mind that this scalar method is good for approximation, but will vary as this is not rounded, where there is rounding at every evolution. That means it should be accurate to about 1-2 points. For kicks the 8max formula was (atk1*1.8+(maxatk1-atk1)*1.8+0.2*(atk1*1.4+(maxatk1-atk1)*1.4+0.2*(atk1*1.2+(maxatk1-atk1)*1.2+0.2(maxatk1)))) and as you can see there's a lot of cancellation, but that won't be the case with other evolution though we could simplify to (X*atk1+Y*maxatk1) of some sort. I modified <a href="Template_Cardset_test.html" title="Template:Cardset test">Template:Cardset test</a> and verified with <a href="indexce29.html?title=Principality_test&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Principality test (page does not exist)">Principality test</a> and the calculation matched the calc. I further verified that the rounding error was relatively small, which it was (1 point max).I'll log back in later after work and sleep.--<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> 05:49, 26 June 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[26/06/2012] More data, nice&#160;:) I will look closer at the calculator when i get back from work. And indeed, the referral and unevolveable cards can't be calculated the normal way. However these are the minority of the cards and can be distinguished easily, receiving a special formula later. Sorry for being unclear, i don't know how to properly use/display all these different evolvement formulas yet, but starting with just listing the most popular ones seems like a good start. If you could apply the formulas with wiki syntax, i think we have a good foundation. I made a quick copy dedicated to these stats on <a href="indexce29.html?title=Principality_test&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Principality test (page does not exist)">Principality test</a> and <a href="Template_Cardset_test.html" title="Template:Cardset test">Template:Cardset test</a>. --<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> 04:10, 26 June 2012 (CDT)

Once the majority of our cards have maxatk and def data i intended to calculate the coefficient aswell, and display the most popular evolve methods on the card's page. Numbers of 2,3 and 4 are based on the archive, which shows the clean values on a 4-0 evo way. We don't gather max stats for those evolved versions for that matter.

</p><p>[25/06/2012]Suggesting these changes so that for 90% (standard evolution cards) we can calculate the final stats based on certain enhancement/evolution types. I have made an excel calculator that is pretty accurate. I can code it in c++ and have access to a programmer in java. What is needed for calculation is Base atk, Base def, Max atk, Max def, all for lvl 1. Then from there add the scaling and evolution bonuses. <b>Also noticed that the numbers for level 2,3,4 on the cards are a bit misleading due to lack of evolution information</b> ie. A level 2 card can be made by multiple combination of a Level 1 base card and a Level 1 max enhanced card. To solve we could add a disclaimer stating that the cards numbers are based on non evolved cards or incorporate the evolving calculator. Contact me if you want a link to a good calc or if you want the calculations or even my calculator. I've also incorporated (excel) a rating factor based on atk &amp; def to the pwr consumption ratio. --<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> 23:34, 25 June 2012 (CDT)
