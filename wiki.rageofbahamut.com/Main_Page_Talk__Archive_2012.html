<p>Heya, I've been working on a replacement for the Evolution page, and the rough final copy of it <b><a href="User_talk_Ragen.html" title="User talk:Ragen">here</a></b>. After I have it scanned for obvious errors and fact checked, would it be ok to completely wipe the old Evolution page in favor for this one?

<p>[12/08/2012] I am new to editing wiki pages so I thought I might post a note here. I've added some things to the <a href="Skeleton_Knight.html" title="Skeleton Knight">Skeleton Knight </a>  discussion page that could use some attention. Thanks! --<a href="index94dc.html?title=User:Rius&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Rius (page does not exist)">Rius</a>
</p><p>[27/07/2012] I agree on the cards appearing in the cards list. Would be nice with a unreleased tag that make them not even show up unless properly linked or perhaps a special list only for unreleased cards. The reason why I added them was because the whole day people has been talking of Brunnhilde being the new referral card due to some troll adding it here. Adding the cards which really might be the upcomming referral cards, seperated from the already released, gives people an idea of what to expect and helped calm the rumor. --<a href="index3667-3.html?title=User:Vmattsson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Vmattsson (page does not exist)">Vmattsson</a>
</p><p>[27/07/2012] Yes i see your point, but I really would mark them as "unreleased", because I think many people are accessing the Cardlist and just looking for cards they don't know, where they see the unreleased cards ... --<a href="User_Mindsonic.html" title="User:Mindsonic">User:Mindsonic</a> 22:04, 27th July 2012
</p><p>[27/07/2012] Personally I really like the non-released cards. Shows where the game is heading towards and most people won't access them anyways. --<a href="User_Hadrune.html" title="User:Hadrune">Hadrune</a>
</p><p>[27/07/2012] And one more proposal i want to make: Its very irritating for me, to have cards included in the wiki, which are not released in the game. I would propose to either delete them till they are released officially or to mark them as "unreleased" --<a href="User_Mindsonic.html" title="User:Mindsonic">User:Mindsonic</a> 17:17, 27th July 2012 (GMT+2)
</p><p>[26/07/2012] Did u need the 5th Evo Stats? I have them of so.  
--<a href="User_RageTrades-Blogger.html" title="User:RageTrades-Blogger">User:RageTrades-Blogger</a> 
</p><p>[26/07/2012] You are creating the platform by hardcoding or do you use a cms? If you need help, i would like to&#160;:) I have nothing to do the next 2 month (then I'll start studying^^).<br /> Hm i think the ajax call would kill more resources, than just loading it by default. But I'm not the best in resource management xD. <br /> I'm working on a small Android app which should fetch the infomation from the wiki and display it transformed into a mobile layout... but I'm not sure if this will work... just a try&#160;:) --<a href="User_Mindsonic.html" title="User:Mindsonic">User:Mindsonic</a> 22:18, 26th July 2012 (GMT+2) 
</p><p>[26/07/2012] @<a href="User_Mindsonic.html" title="User:Mindsonic">User:Mindsonic</a> Since a price is no fact i don't think it belongs here. But im starting up a trading platform atm, that should -in the end- be able to calculate the avarage value of a card, generated on demand.<br /> 
Btw, regarding button to switch basic and advanced stats. I thought i already replied, but apparently it did not came through&#160;:(. I'll quickly reply it this time; If the button fetches the additional data by another ajax call, it would be ok, but if it only shows or hides columns it would be a waste of sever resources fetching not used data. --<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> (<a href="User_talk_Ezo.html" title="User talk:Ezo">talk</a>) 23:03, 26 July 2012 (UTC)
</p><p>[26/07/2012] And how about adding a variable to each card, which shows the current price in Holy Powder? maybe with a timestamp, to show if its the current value? --<a href="User_Mindsonic.html" title="User:Mindsonic">User:Mindsonic</a> 16:49, 26th July 2012 (GMT+2)
</p><p>[23/07/2012] How about adding a button, which allows you to switch between basic (only important information) and advanced (all statistics) view? --<a href="User_Mindsonic.html" title="User:Mindsonic">User:Mindsonic</a> 19:15, 23th July 2012 (GMT+2)
</p><p>[23/07/2012] I agree, although i don't really want to stuff the table much further.. I think having a second "analyzing" table, will be better for this purpose. Then we can remove the max attack also from the main table, and to the analyze table, including the 8-15 stats. I will add this data to the card's semantic data. --<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> (<a href="User_talk_Ezo.html" title="User talk:Ezo">talk</a>) 16:02, 23 July 2012 (UTC) 
</p><p>[23/07/2012] Can we add a power efficiency master table for the Category:Cards section? Would be interesting to check the figures and see which cards are the most efficient per power point spent. Perhaps add a note about that those rankings are only based on the clean cards (so without effects proccing). --<a href="User_Hadrune.html" title="User:Hadrune">Hadrune</a>
</p><p>[16/07/2012] @Svtanthony, that's what I thought. Then the cards' ATK and DEF should match the values in the Archive. I had changed some cards that way only to see someone change it back to the values displayed on the card itself in inventory and I wanted to make sure I wasn't screwing it up for everyone else. --<a href="indexdd9e.html?title=User:Wlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wlin (page does not exist)">Wlin</a>
</p><p>[16/07/2012] @Wlin, what needs to be entered is the base value without bonuses so that we can avoid some confusion that could arise from differing evolution methods. IE. lv2 card could be made from 2 fully enhanced Lv1 cards or 2 base cards or 1 of each. Then lv3 cards have more possible combinations. For most cards.( non referral and non treasure)
</p>
<dl><dd>lv2 = base x 1.2</dd>
<dd>lv3 = base x 1.4</dd>
<dd>lv4 = base x 1.8</dd></dl>
<p>will possibly code this for future cards so that users need only enter lv1 card values. Still TBD.--<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> 16:36, 16 July 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[16/07/2012] @Hadrune: Hmm, I must be doing something wrong because it wasn't letting me delete or overwrite the original image. I'll try again later, thanks. --<a href="indexdd9e.html?title=User:Wlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wlin (page does not exist)">Wlin</a>
</p><p>[16/07/2012] Just delete/reupload Akeron to Archelon, was from Japanese wiki. --<a href="User_Hadrune.html" title="User:Hadrune">Hadrune</a>
</p><p>[16/07/2012] Also, can we get a consensus here regarding what ATK and DEF values are supposed to be entered for the cards? I've been putting in what shows up in the Archive from in-game, but I've noticed that some users are entering the numbers that appear on the actual card, which includes the 5% evolve bonus. --<a href="indexdd9e.html?title=User:Wlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wlin (page does not exist)">Wlin</a>
</p><p>[13/07/2012] Is there any way to rename or delete an uploaded image file? The Archelon image was uploaded under the name Akeron.JPG. There are no references to that image according to the image page, so I assume it would be safe to rename or delete it so the image can be re-uploaded under the correct name. --<a href="indexdd9e.html?title=User:Wlin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Wlin (page does not exist)">Wlin</a>
</p><p>[12/07/2012] Hence why I put the speculation bar on the events. It's to make it easier. --<a href="Special_Contributions/218.186.18.html" title="Special:Contributions/218.186.18.254">218.186.18.254</a> 11:48, 12 July 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[11/07/2012] As long as we clearly mark those as speculation I don't see the problem. I feel that the Japanese version will keep on deviating from our version but they are certainly using many elements which makes the 'rumor mill' quite interesting. 
</p><p>[11/07/2012] Just saying, they are not sure if they want to release the 5th evolves yet. They want to keep the game a bit different from the Japanese version (which is why I put the Slayers of Fafner on the wikia while everybody told me it would be a special card pack and I was an idiot) and they are not sure if a 5th evolve is a good way to go with the non-Japanese version of the game. Now, as the Admin of the Wikia for Rage of Bahamut, I've already decided I wanted to put all the info I could get on the Wikia regardless of it actually getting released or not. What you guys do with it is your own kind of thing&#160;;)
You can either take the same direction as I am taking, or you could always put stuff on the site which is actually gonna happen exactly as you say. <a href="User_Bahumut5.html" title="User:Bahumut5">Bahumut5</a> 19:14, 10 July 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[04/07/2012] thanks, i coded that into a switch that will ultimately call the 5th evolution formulas. --<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> 14:30, 4 July 2012 (CDT)

Man&#160;: Yuki, Jean D'Arc, Lancelot &amp; KA<br />

</p><p>[03/07/2012] Do you know how many cards have a fifth level evolution? If its a few, we can create a simple formula for determining if it has a fifth level evolution. Otherwise could you add a (T/F) field for fifth level evolution? Thx (BTW, love the changes. LOL) --<a href="User_Svtanthony.html" title="User:Svtanthony">Svtanthony</a> 19:03, 3 July 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[03/07/2012] Few more <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="indexf01b-2.html?title=Special:WhatLinksHere&amp;target=Template%3ADemons">pages</a> that should be updated to new <a href="Template_Cardset.html" title="Template:Cardset">template</a>.

And at last, i had to enable caching for the wiki, as it was crashing the server multiple times a day due to high traffic.

</p><p>[30/06/2012] Hmm a bit of a strange question, but am I the only one who is sometimes getting a weird looking "My Page" page? Instead of 'Inbox' at the top it says 'News_Available', for example, and there's weird hyphenated text everywhere, like 'You_have_presents_waiting' and 'You_have_a_free_vendor_available'... The usual selection of card images under the order name is reduced to one card slot which shows the default 'empty' graphic.

</p><p>[07/06/2012]<br /> Couple things. First, stepped out for about three weeks, and hot damn this looks good! Keep it up! Second, I am really frustrated that we can't put a pin on the enhancement formulas. Maybe we can compile data, but I talk about that more in the discussions on the relevant pages. Third, Ezo, I was looking at the spreadsheet, and the only thing I would criticize is the random card part. I agree it would be cool, but I question it's utility, but like Jounochi says, not a big deal/hurry. --Anon<br />
</p><p>[04/06/2012]<br /> Would suggest adding a Card link in the menu. Also some information on evolving and enhancing cards, use of the three main stats and trading perhaps could be useful as content? --<a href="User_Hadrune.html" title="User:Hadrune">Hadrune</a><br />
</p><p>[04/06/2012]<br /> Structure looks fine. About the card lists, can't we just add another row with rarity? Seems like an easier option and allows users to search on whatever preference they might have. --<a href="User_Hadrune.html" title="User:Hadrune">Hadrune</a><br />
</p><p>[04/06/2012]<br /> I designed a bit in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlBazDLdUvfPdDZyOC1KYllzbVBScU5XRVhSdDJBdUE">a spreadsheet</a> (who needs photoshop), for the structure of the homepage.
I realized it's kinda hard to make an edit to it, but you can copy to a new tab, and edit in there. <br />
Regarding card lists; I think the <a href="Category_Cards.html" title="Category:Cards">Category:Cards</a> is pretty nice now, and we can make lists of missing cards at the child faction categories. Can we replace the <a href="List_of_Man.html" title="List of Man" class="mw-redirect">List of Man</a> with <a href="Category_Man_cards.html" title="Category:Man cards">Category:Man cards</a> now, or first split the table up in rarity groups? --<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> 12:46, 4 June 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[03/06/2012]<br /> Content &amp; structure needs to be uniform before we agree imo. Can't we ask an excel file from mobage with all the cards? I do agree with Jounochi however, what is missing can be filled in the coming months. --<a href="User_Hadrune.html" title="User:Hadrune">Hadrune</a><br />
</p><p>[03/06/2012]<br /> Content wise I think we are pretty good.  I think that the main page should have the notes stretched at the top and just to the left of the bottom of that box have the content.  Latest news could go in another box just to the right of that.  It is a wiki however and I believe that those things shouldn't really matter right now.  --<a href="User_Jounochi.html" title="User:Jounochi">Jounochi</a> 12:19, 3 June 2012 (CDT)

<br /> Mobage offered to make a link to the wiki page; but i wasn't sure about the servers holding the traffic spike, but that probably will be fine. Are we ready content wise for the great public?

</p><p>[03/06/2012]<br /> We should get the community portal up and running imo. Next to the clarity for fans about the correct fb/twit/forums/fanpages for RoB we can also get more awareness and contributors to reach the wiki. --<a href="User_Hadrune.html" title="User:Hadrune">Hadrune</a><br />
</p><p>[03/06/2012]<br /> If you want to reach contributors, why don't you do something like the guys here: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</a> <br />
Put up a main page with 2 columns: the left one "for readers" and a right column "for contributors". As long as you don't need to scroll down,this should be efficient enough to reach coontributors. --anon 08:23, 3 June 2012 (CDT)

</p><p>Is it possible to have updated the cards obtainable via the quests? Such as what is attained when going through the normal quests. That would probably be very helpful
</p><p>[31/05/2012]<br /> Yea not sure how to communicate templates, For data consumers/visitors (over 2k a day now) template names are useless.. We would have to reach contributors with such information. What's a good place for that?

</p><p>[31/05/2012]<br /> Nice Ezo, btw should I update the main page with the stuff the admins posted? It seems like an important announcement. Also ROBforums is down and there were speculation that the reason why in game accounts were hacked is because most user on ROBforum uses a the same Username, it's a possibility that they uses the same PW as well and thus hackers who hacked the site can get access to those accounts ingame and siphon the cards away. --<a href="User_Mr_Grunt.html" title="User:Mr Grunt">Mr Grunt</a> 10:50, 31 May 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[31/05/2012]<br />I created a new template based on the a card page, which is very easy to call;

</p><p>[31/05/2012]<br />  On the reward page after the individual rewards for number of kills there was a small area that mentioned secret or unknown challenges.  It doesn't look like it's on the event page on the wiki but it mentions something about a mystery reward at the bottom.  I believe though the event meant that there is multiple rewards for fulfilling certain requirements.  You wouldn't happen to know anything about this would you?  --<a href="User_Jounochi.html" title="User:Jounochi">Jounochi</a> 24:11, 31 May 2012 (CDT)

</p><p>[24/05/2012]<br /> Good job on the template! About the max atk/def: dimonblades suggested a good way to determine a cards max values in the card discussion section below.<br />
It's also used in a separate section for <a href="Lilith_Liz.html" title="Lilith Liz">Lilith Liz</a> and <a href="Princess.html" title="Princess">Princess</a>. --anon 17:04, 24 May 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[24/05/2012]<br /> Thanks, it's more centralized now (all the <a href="Template_Demons.html" title="Template:Demons" class="mw-redirect">Demons</a>, <a href="Template_Gods.html" title="Template:Gods" class="mw-redirect">Gods</a>, <a href="Template_Man.html" title="Template:Man" class="mw-redirect">Man</a> templates are identical, besides their first line defining faction). And indeed, until we found the formula to the max dmg, i suggest we hide the variable. Lots of cards don't have rarity set though, and for sorting/categorizing/display purposes i'd like to have it separated from the card name. I updated some cards here and there, but there are still enough <b><a href="Category_Cards.html" title="Category:Cards">remaining</a></b>, recognizable by their empty rarity field. --<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> 13:22, 24 May 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[24/05/2012]<br />  I really like what you've done with the demon template and it would be awesome if you used it on the man and gods.  Also, will that take off the max stats?

@Tenlaven You're right. Value of a card is 150%,200% and 300% of base form. This does not apply to referral cards,which step up in rarity with each form like <a href="Princess.html" title="Princess">Princess</a> and most likely Hild ,too.--anon 10:25, 22 May 2012 (CDT)

</p><p>[21/05/2012]<br /> @Jounochi Would be nice, but we would have to avoid entering duplicate data.
Depending on what we want to show in the table (all cards, or just first/last form) i can setup semantic media wiki to generate a "table row template" which retrieves data from the card-set's page. Then we can make an uniform display for all factions and avoid duplicate input/updates.
--<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> 04:45, 21 May 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[20/05/2012]<br />  Do we want the Gods and Demons page to be a table like the Humans page?  Other than filling in card information what else needs to be done?  --<a href="User_Jounochi.html" title="User:Jounochi">Jounochi</a> 18:30, 20 May 2012
</p><p>[19/05/2012]<br /> Thanks. Something I've noticed about the prices is that there is some consistency to it. The "++" level card seems to always be twice the value of the base, and the final forms are thrice the value. The "+" level is half the final's value. If this doesn't hold true on all of them let me know, but so far I've been correct. --<a href="User_Tenlaven.html" title="User:Tenlaven">Tenlaven</a> 22:23, 19 May 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[19/05/2012]<br /> I'll help you out Tenlaven.  I've been slowly chopping at that page and I'll start getting the prices down on some of them.  By the by, we need to make a wiki order!

[09/05/2012]<br /> <a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">user:ezo</a> Phoenix is  a treasure card, which cannot evolve. I just added that to the wiki's <a href="Cards.html" title="Cards">cards</a> page. 
@mrgrunt, I'll see how that works, and avoid referral spam. 
</p><p>[09/05/2012]<br />Garanoth: Not sure if this is the place for this, but I can literally find nothing else about this game. In this wiki's section on evolving cards, you use the example of a Rare card. Can you actually evolve rares? I've tried multiple times (With 2x of the Phoenix, and with 2x of a rare Knight (on the man side)). Can I get some info on how this works, or if it does? Can someone who's more knowledgeable make a wiki page about it? I have a ton of these piling up expecting to be able to evolve them at some point, but it isn't happening.

Agreed, We can also switch to the automated generated pages (see <a href="Category_Gods_cards.html" title="Category:Gods cards">category:gods cards</a>) I can change the display (instead of the table) and split up the list based on rarity or what we want. Problem is that the list will only show cards that exists in the wiki. So it's harder to find cards that are missing. --<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> 08:27, 3 June 2012 (CDT)

There is some discrepancy between the listing of the cards. I would suggest we adopt one format and make sure all three sections conform to that format? --<a href="indexd37e.html?title=Hadrune&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Hadrune (page does not exist)">Hadrune</a> 
</p><p>[31/05/2012]<br /> Good to hear that! Because the rounding errors, i still think we should store the max atk/def at the base card. Incase the data is not available, we can use the *2,5 coefficient.
I also found a forumla that calculated the atk/def stats of a card in 8max, 6max, 6-2 max and 4max evo. It seemed pretty accurate and based on the base card stats.

Apparently, the enhancement coefficient is 2.5&#160;! Source: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://robforums.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=taeb7566ji0fh3mj3c8op0gck5&amp;topic=4846.0">http://robforums.com/index.php?PHPSESSID=taeb7566ji0fh3mj3c8op0gck5&amp;topic=4846.0</a> <br />
This works great for <a href="Lilith_Liz.html" title="Lilith Liz">Lilith Liz</a>. The base ATK * 2.5 will get you to 6600 ATK and same for Liz's second form. However, for <a href="Bunny_Lilith_Limil.html" title="Bunny Lilith Limil">Bunny Lilith Limil</a> and Alberich the deviation for the coefficient is less than 0.01. So there are up to 15 points missing. --anon 16:44, 27 May 2012

So you say that the number of max enchanting a card is fixed per card, and will be summed to the card's base stats (which can be higher then normal if the base card was evolved). 
But then we still need to figure out the card's gained per level stats, and they are similar for every rarity. And then for the max stats, also include the base cards of previous evolutions, in most enchanted form.. --<a href="User_Ezo.html" title="User:Ezo">Ezo</a> 05:24, 25 May 2012 (CDT)
</p><p>[22/05/2012]
Might I suggest that the maxATK and maxDEF values be the + amount that is added to the stat of the card when it is brought up to max level? That way no matter how they evolved a card, bringing it to max will add that much to the stats of the card.

Autogenerated tables are 'broken' now.
The "Card" template used to had metadata columns hidden in the template, which fed the tables.
I'll modify the man/gods/demons tempaltes now, so the form 1 card data will be used. 
Done.

Let me know how your findings go. By the way, there seems to be an issue with the cards using the "Card" template vs man/god/demon so the tables are not properly generating under each sub category. We need to fix the cards or fix the forumla (or both) so that the tables pull all the relevant data. --<a href="index0c5b.html?title=User:Preisty&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Preisty (page does not exist)">Preisty</a>

I will agree that Max Atk and Max Def is ambiguous, Except for the 1st form's max level, after evolving it will be hard to know but the Scale level I've checked is some what around 1.8 - 1.95 of the 1st form's max stats. I'm now working on an 8 card evolution Gramr, so when I'm done with it I'll list down and see if there's a fomular to know. BTW this will be under another heading for discussion of stats. --<a href="User_Mr_Grunt.html" title="User:Mr Grunt">Mr Grunt</a> 20:59, 17 May 2012 (CDT)

For simplicity...everyone now needs to know how to evolve their cards(the wiki way) and needs to know it prior to submitting to the wiki. And people still post wrong data regarding a card's base value(Yes,they do sometimes! Even i got it wrong at first!). And evolving is tid bit harder (see the questions about evolving;yes,people don't RTFM) Another thing on simplicity: If you can say "hey,we can do it this way or the other way" ,then it's definitely ambiguous and chances are people may interpret it the worst way possible. --anon
</p><p>[17/05/2012]<br /> How are the fields ambiguous. The the assumption is a perfect evolution since it is MAX as in max attainable. The only variable is that AQ's can increase max stats now. If you want to go further we could do 5/6/8/16 card evolutions however I think for simplicity it is easier to base on a regular 4 card evolution. --preisty
</p><p>[17/05/2012]<br /> MaxATK and MaxDEF fields are ambiguous! What kind of data belongs to that field (especially)for higher forms? Imagine someone ,who hasn't enhanced prior forms and now enhances a card to its max level. Does this count as max? Or does this count only for those,who enhanced all the prior versions? The latter won't work nicely for final form cards,because of a lot of missing or inaccurate data.  --anon
</p><p>[17/05/2012]<br /> Templates updated to have a MAXATK and MAXDEF field. This will allow people without the cards to see their max stat potentials. --preisty

<p>I did my own research and math into figuring out which way to enhance is more cost effective.  To simplify the math, I based my formulas off of the percentage of leveling the skills of my fully evolved and max enhanced Sektor.  The skill of the Sektor was at level 3.
</p><p>An unevolved HN card provides 4% chance of skill up.  A fully evolved HN card (now a rare) provides 6% chance.  All of the percent variables are written as whole numbers.  For example, 5% was represented by a 5. 
</p><p>My formulas were:
</p><p>Unevolved   &lt;cost per&#160;%&gt; = &lt;Cost of enhancement&gt; / &lt;percentage gained&gt;)
</p><p>Evolved     &lt;Cost Per&#160;%&gt; = ( 4 * &lt;cost of single evolution&gt; + &lt;Cost of enhancement&gt; ) / &lt;percentage gained&gt;
</p><p>in my trial problenm it ended up being:
</p><p>Cost per&#160;% = &lt;Cost of Enhancement&gt; / 4
</p><p>Cost per&#160;% = (1725 + &lt;Cost of enhancement&gt;) / 6
</p><p><br />
</p><p>I do not have enough data to further refine this formula (such as how the current skill of the card affects the percentage gained. I tested and noticed that increasing experience yielded a similar percentage difference on experience gained as the chance of skill ups. I entered these formulas into a spreedsheet.  My results showed that using unevolved HN feeders are the most cost effective until the enhanced card is level 68. If my math is correct, this is a great starting off point to figure out which way to enhance costs less.  you can contact me at winerdarfatherofebis@gmail.com
