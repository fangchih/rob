<p>Hey Cormyre,
</p><p>I've got a few problems with the wiki:
As can be seen on the recent changes page, moving 3 pictures (Princess Juliet and Officer Romeo/General Lord Romeo) has caused major problems with all 3 of them. I don't know what went wrong as the wikis standart procedure to move those files was used. As can be seen on the new card pack page <a href="Cogs_of_Heaven.html" title="Cogs of Heaven">Cogs of Heaven</a>, Lioness Tamers image seems to cause some problems as well - although it's the original picture. Furthermore at least for me, most of the times when opening new pages in the wiki, all sidebars and other things beside the page itself are missing. Adding this post to the discussion page caused a 500 internal server error message. I logged out of the wiki and tried to log back in. But it seems wiki doesn't recognise my PW anymore. I tried to reset my PW but the first time wiki should send my an email, it caused some kind of php error. Since then it only gives me the message that only 1 mail can be send in 24hr. Since I didn't receive any mail, I think I'll have to wait until tomorrow to try again - at least if there isn't any kind of wiki admin. Do you have any idea what went wrong? =/
</p><p>Morgan
</p>
<dl><dd> I finally managed to log back into the wiki, but the internal problems are still there. --<a href="User_Morgan.html" title="User:Morgan">Morgan</a> (<a href="User_talk_Morgan.html" title="User talk:Morgan">talk</a>) 19:46, 9 January 2014 (EST)</dd></dl>

<p>Yeah, I'm seeing problems allover the place and can't do anything about it.  Unfortunately I'm not an admin and the ones that were active I knew retired... I've been trying to get in contact with the owner unsuccessfully.  The 500 error codes prior meant the site was running out of storage I believe (it's been a few months since it's been a problem)...

<p>Kuro didn't have user rights I don't think, and his link to the main admins is the same as mine (retired).  I have a few messages to John to get me in contact with ownership, only thing I can do at the moment... unfortunately.
</p><p>But yeah, last time it was because of images and they were gone through getting rid of things that don't need to be, I plan on editing all of them down to a lower res (50k max) if I get the opportunity.  But this problem is something that may always be and it's kind of an inevitability that we'll run out of room&#160;:(

<p>Hi, say... do you have any idea why some of the Card won't show up in the Card lists with all their stats (8-15 atk/def stats and so on). There are many white spaces in those tables. I tried to figure out what the difference is between the cards that show up with all stats and the cards that don't. But I can't find any difference in the cards themselves. Even editing the Card List and saving it again without changes - which normally helps to add new data, won't do anything to list those cards. --<a href="User_Morgan.html" title="User:Morgan">Morgan</a> (<a href="User_talk_Morgan.html" title="User talk:Morgan">talk</a>) 14:01, 24 March 2014 (EDT)

<p>Hrm, do you have an example (like what exact path you're using)? I don't use the card lists much...

<dl><dd><dl><dd> For Example if you take a look at <a href="Man_S_Rare.html" title="Man S Rare">Man S Rare</a>, and sort it by 4-7 DEF low to high, there are some cards that don't have any stats but the base atk/def. Of course there are referral cards in there as well and they won't have their data listed, but <a href="Winged_Caster.html" title="Winged Caster">Winged Caster</a> and <a href="Summertime_Lou.html" title="Summertime Lou">Summertime Lou</a> don't have any stats in that list also.

<p>So yeah, it looks like anything that was entered or modified during our issues may not have built variables correctly to the cache... so they were blank, I've went through R-L in Man and have edited the ones showing up like that (good opportunity for some cleaning up of missing info) and refreshed the tables and they're fine.
